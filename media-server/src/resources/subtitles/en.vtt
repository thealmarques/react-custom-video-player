2
00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.455
Nick, this was a
tragedy, but it's not why we're here.

3
00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.791
What, are we fighting
the weather now?

4
00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.627
Locals say the cyclone
had a face.

5
00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.229
People see things
when they're under stress.

6
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.232
That does not mean
that this is the start

7
00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.903
to some other
big world-ending...

8
00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:17.144
Who are you?

9
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.183
You don't want
any part of this.

28
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.795
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

29
00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.164
for their help with that
touching video tribute.

30
00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.300
This year has been
nothing short of...

31
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.635
is crazy.
It's, like, insane.

32
00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:52.635
- Jason.
- What?

33
00:02:52.637 --> 00:02:53.972
No swearing.

34
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.841
It's the last day of school.
We're good.

35
00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:57.974
Historic.

36
00:02:57.976 --> 00:02:59.377
Over five years ago,

37
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.579
half of all life
in the universe,

38
00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.414
<i>including our own
Midtown High...</i>

39
00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.849
<i>...was wiped from existence.</i>

40
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.419
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

41
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.653
<i>brought us back.</i>

42
00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:13.623
They called it "the Blip."

43
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.326
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i>

44
00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.295
<i>But our classmates
that didn't Blip</i>

45
00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:20.963
<i>had grown five years older.</i>

46
00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:23.266
Yeah, my little brother
is now older than me.

47
00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:25.101
Yeah, it's math.

48
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:28.237
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

49
00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.341
and had already taken midterms,

50
00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.010
the school made us
start the year

51
00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.343
over from the beginning.

52
00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.980
It's totally unfair.
It's not right.

53
00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.615
Tigers...

54
00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.450
...it's been
a long, dramatic,

55
00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.184
somewhat
confusing road.

56
00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.720
<i>As we draw this year
to a close,</i>

57
00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:45.591
<i>it's time to move on...</i>

58
00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.659
<i>to a new phase
of our lives.</i>

59
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.260
<i>Pray nothing crazy
happens again</i>

60
00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.362
<i>because are the Avengers
a thing anymore?</i>

61
00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:53.865
<i>Does anyone even have a plan?</i>

62
00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.366
I have a plan.

63
00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.801
First, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

64
00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.203
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual headphone adapter

65
00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.205
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

66
00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:03.507
- Okay.
- Three,

67
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.375
when we go to Venice,
Venice is famous

68
00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.178
- for making stuff out of glass.
- True.

69
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.046
I'm gonna buy her
a black dahlia necklace

70
00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.015
because her favorite flower
is the black dahlia

71
00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.515
- because of, well...
- The murder.

72
00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:14.484
The murder.
Four, when we go to Paris,

73
00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.921
I'm gonna take her
to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

74
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.522
- give her the necklace.
- Oh.

75
00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.526
Then, five,
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

76
00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:23.693
Then, six,
hopefully she tells me

77
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:24.962
she feels
the same way.

78
00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.363
Oh, don't forget
step seven.

79
00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.368
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

80
00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:30.868
Why?

81
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.736
We're gonna be
bachelors in Europe.

82
00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:33.736
- Ned.
- Look,

83
00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:34.805
I may not know much,

84
00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.140
but I do know this:

85
00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.010
Europeans love
Americans.

86
00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.176
Really?

87
00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:41.546
More than half
are women.

88
00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:43.214
Okay. Sure.

89
00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.116
But... I really like MJ,
man, okay?

90
00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.852
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

91
00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:50.587
Sometimes I catch her
looking at me,

92
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.055
I feel like
I've stood up...

93
00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.890
- She's coming.
- What up, dorks?

94
00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.525
Excited about
the science trip?

95
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.861
Hey, yeah. We're just
talking about the trip.

96
00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:58.996
Yeah,
and Peter's plan.

97
00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.363
You have a plan?

98
00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.366
I don't...
I don't have a plan.

99
00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:06.003
He's... He's just gonna
collect tiny spoons

100
00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.072
when we're traveling
to other countries.

101
00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.640
Like a...
Like a grandmother?

102
00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.474
I'm not collecting
tiny spoons.

103
00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:13.075
He's collecting
tiny spoons.

104
00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:14.613
Oh, okay, well...

105
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.580
that was a real
roller coaster.

106
00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:19.582
By the way, travel tip:

107
00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:21.818
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

108
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.186
so the government can't
track you while abroad.

109
00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:26.625
Smart... Will do.

110
00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.834
Dude, I think
that went really great.

111
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:39.435
When I Blipped
back to my apartment,

112
00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:42.339
the family that was living there
was very confused.

113
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.075
The wife thought
that I was a mistress.

114
00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:46.976
The grandma thought
that I was a ghost.

115
00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.313
It was... It was really a mess.

116
00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.981
Thank you all for coming out

117
00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.618
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

118
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.919
And, of course,
thanks to our very own

119
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.455
Spider-Man!

120
00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:11.301
Thank you, Miss Parker,
for having me.

121
00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:13.707
And thank you, you guys,
for having me.

122
00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.674
And thank you,
Spider-Man.

123
00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:20.676
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos.

124
00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:21.678
Thank you!

125
00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.352
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

126
00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:31.087
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

127
00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.291
I was a little stiff.
I wasn't in the pocket.

128
00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:36.159
- No, I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

129
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.796
Uh, yeah, I felt that too.
I felt that too.

130
00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.031
- It's fine, fine.
- Okay.

131
00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:41.632
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.067
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

133
00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:46.071
Hey, sorry I'm late.

134
00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.404
Happy. Hey.

135
00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:49.573
Oh, you look lovely.

136
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.642
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.680
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

138
00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:55.912
It's a new beard.

139
00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:57.147
It's my... My Blip beard.

140
00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:58.883
'Cause I grew it
in the Blip.

141
00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.683
It's a Blip beard.

142
00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:02.318
I see. Yeah.

143
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.388
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced.

144
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.058
Can you believe it?
It's enormous.

145
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.359
Not the amount,
the size.

146
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.161
The amount's nice too.
They're generous.

147
00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:13.698
Pepper Potts said, sorry
she couldn't be here.

148
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.666
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno

149
00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:18.204
under the vegan lasagna.

150
00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.238
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

151
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.909
Will do.

152
00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.380
What just happened?

153
00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.849
Heads up,
Nick Fury's calling you.

154
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.918
- Nick Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.820
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

156
00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.988
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

157
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.390
If it was that important,

158
00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:42.392
he'd probably call
someone else, not me.

159
00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:45.097
Apparently not.

160
00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:50.234
No caller ID.
That's him.

161
00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.568
I don't wanna
talk to Fury.

162
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.635
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

163
00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:53.938
If you don't talk to him,

164
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.438
I have to and I don't want to.

165
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.243
- Why not?
- I'm scared. Answer the phone.

166
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.411
- You sent Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.046
You don't send Fury
to voicemail.

168
00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.279
They're calling me.

169
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:05.082
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

170
00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.952
I'm gonna call him. I promise,
I'm gonna call him. I will.

171
00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.919
You do not ghost
Nick Fury.

172
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:11.623
I promise you, I'll call him.

173
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:14.558
After my trip.

174
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.826
Hey!

175
00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:19.963
Yeah, hi.
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

176
00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.068
Okay, one question at a time.

177
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.903
Are you
the head Avenger?

178
00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.337
Are you
the head Avenger now?

179
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:28.804
Uh, no, I'm not.

180
00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:30.942
If aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

181
00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.976
If aliens come back,
what will you do?

182
00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:34.848
Does anyone have
neighborhood questions?

183
00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:37.648
Sean Winford,
<i>Queens Tribune.</i>

184
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.817
What's it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

185
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.184
Those are
big shoes to fill.

186
00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:46.222
I'mma...

187
00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:48.324
I'm gonna go.
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

188
00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:30.502
Okay.

189
00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.042
Hungry?

190
00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:41.077
So sorry.

191
00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:44.414
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

192
00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:46.850
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

193
00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.986
So, what's up? You can dodge
bullets but not bananas?

194
00:09:49.988 --> 00:09:51.987
No, I just really
need this vacation.

195
00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:53.659
I need a break.

196
00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.228
You deserve it. Mm.

197
00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:58.998
Yeah.

198
00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.698
You know what?

199
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.833
You should pack your suit,
just in case.

200
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:05.003
I have a tingle about it.

201
00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.874
Please stop saying
"tingle," May.

202
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.074
No.

203
00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.986
No. No, I'm not.

204
00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.390
Vacation, yeah!

205
00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.290
Can you help
me get my stuff up?

206
00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:30.562
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

207
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.231
Give me a tablet.

208
00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.899
Do you want first shift
or second?

209
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.268
I could take either.

210
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.370
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

211
00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:40.803
I can't chaperone
kids alone.

212
00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:42.038
Yo, Parker.

213
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.439
This is called
an airplane.

214
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.074
It's like buses
you're used to,

215
00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:46.976
except it flies over
poor neighborhoods

216
00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:48.577
instead of driving
through them.

217
00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:50.213
- Ma'am?
- Hmm?

218
00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:53.417
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

219
00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.251
I'll take that.

220
00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:57.456
She's lying.
I don't even know this girl.

221
00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:02.495
Classic MJ, right?

222
00:11:04.028 --> 00:11:06.230
Did you know Brad
was coming?

223
00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.231
It... It's so weird.

224
00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:10.201
Like, one day,
he's that kid who cried

225
00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:11.802
and got nosebleeds
all the time,

226
00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.303
and suddenly, we Blip back,

227
00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.371
and he's totally ripped
and super nice

228
00:11:15.373 --> 00:11:17.040
and all these girls
are after him.

229
00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:18.607
Not all the girls
are after him.

230
00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:20.443
No, man,
they're all after him.

231
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:22.178
- Yeah.
- Here.

232
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.247
Anyway, on to more important
things. It's a nine-hour flight.

233
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:27.152
We can play <i>Beast Slayers</i>
the whole time.

234
00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:29.221
Are you excited?

235
00:11:30.622 --> 00:11:32.125
I need help
to sit next to MJ.

236
00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:34.924
Seriously?

237
00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:35.925
Yes, seriously.

238
00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:37.159
What about our plan?

239
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:38.828
American bachelors
in Europe.

240
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.664
That's your plan.
That's a solo plan.

241
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.734
Come on, this is my plan.

242
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.303
Please.

243
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.174
Uh, hey, guys.

244
00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:53.175
Uh, there's an old lady

245
00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:54.410
sitting in front of us

246
00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:56.279
wearing a crazy amount
of perfume,

247
00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:59.482
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

248
00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:01.851
Um, you know, Betty,
if you could just

249
00:12:01.853 --> 00:12:03.752
switch seats with him,
that would be...

250
00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:04.890
He's allergic
to perfume?

251
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.092
Yeah, yeah,
because, um, it...

252
00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:09.693
It makes his eyes water,

253
00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.163
- and he can't really...
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

254
00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:13.329
Oh, uh...

255
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.331
From experience,

256
00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.631
allergies are no joke.

257
00:12:15.633 --> 00:12:17.601
I can feel hives
breaking out already.

258
00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:19.001
MJ, stand up.

259
00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:20.871
Ned, take MJ's spot.

260
00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:22.773
MJ, you take my spot.

261
00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.408
Peter,
let's get you out of there.

262
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.342
- Sorry.
- Zach, Sebastian,

263
00:12:26.344 --> 00:12:28.745
you take Ned and Peter's seats.

264
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.247
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

265
00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:32.882
Your safety is my
responsibility.

266
00:12:32.884 --> 00:12:35.084
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

267
00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:37.587
I got it for now.
Let's go, Peter!

268
00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.425
Let's go!

269
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.267
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

270
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.904
So did you wanna
play <i>Beast Slayer?</i>

271
00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:57.073
Nope.

272
00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:59.543
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

273
00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.978
- No.
- Got it. Ahem.

274
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.848
Did I tell you my wife
pretended to Blip out?

275
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.586
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

276
00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:10.153
We had a fake funeral
for her...

277
00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:11.489
Well, the funeral
was real

278
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.188
because I thought
she was dead.

279
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.524
Do you wanna
see the video?

280
00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:16.192
Oh, I got
a dual headphone adapter

281
00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.593
if you wanna
watch a movie.

282
00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:20.097
Only if it's depressing.
Or hilarious.

283
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.030
Oh, you have
a dual headphone adapter.

284
00:13:22.032 --> 00:13:23.165
We can watch together.

285
00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:24.701
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

286
00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.437
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

287
00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:28.538
<i>Our flight time today will
be eight hours,</i>

288
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.640
<i>49 minutes
to Venice, Italy.</i>

289
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.690
Oh! Oh!

290
00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:39.643
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

291
00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:42.345
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

292
00:14:42.347 --> 00:14:44.114
Dude, don't worry,
okay?

293
00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.281
I'm sure
that's nothing.

294
00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:46.283
Hey, babe.

295
00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.549
Can you hold this for me?

296
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:49.221
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

297
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:59.196
What was that?

298
00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.130
Uh, well,

299
00:15:01.132 --> 00:15:03.634
we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

300
00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.202
we have a lot in common.

301
00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.837
So, uh, we're boyfriend
and girlfriend now.

302
00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:10.707
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

303
00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.476
Peter, those were the words
of a boy.

304
00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:16.011
And that boy met a woman.

305
00:15:16.013 --> 00:15:18.847
A very strong
and powerful woman.

306
00:15:18.849 --> 00:15:21.784
And now,
that boy's a man.

307
00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:24.053
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

308
00:15:29.026 --> 00:15:31.160
There's nothing in there.
I swear.

309
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.678
These, no.

310
00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:00.256
Sorry. Sorry.

311
00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:02.525
- I'm here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:04.694
- I'm here.
- Thank goodness.

313
00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.230
Looks like we're here.

314
00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.265
They're doing renovations
to the place.

315
00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.900
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

316
00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:46.502
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

317
00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:48.237
Come on, man.

318
00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:50.774
Everyone, here we are.

319
00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:53.009
Whoa!

320
00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:54.476
- Wow!
- Come on in.

321
00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:56.112
This place
is sinking.

322
00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:58.313
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

323
00:16:58.315 --> 00:17:00.783
Okay, everybody,
drop your bags off.

324
00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:03.652
We're gonna meet at the
da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

325
00:17:03.654 --> 00:17:05.822
- <i>¡Vámanos!</i>
- It's <i>"andiamo."</i>

326
00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.122
<i>Andiamo!</i>

327
00:17:07.124 --> 00:17:08.757
When in Rome,
do as Romans do.

328
00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:10.826
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

329
00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:18.834
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

330
00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:20.469
I'm here in
St. Marco Polo's...

331
00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.140
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

332
00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:39.024
Oh!

333
00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:49.966
Three, two, one...
say pizza!

334
00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.302
Pizza! Pizza time!

335
00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:13.489
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>

336
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:14.990
Hi. Uh...

337
00:18:14.992 --> 00:18:16.559
I'm looking for a, uh...

338
00:18:27.805 --> 00:18:29.139
It's perfect.

339
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.749
What?

340
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:42.052
The most perfect word.

341
00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.887
Italians created it,
I discovered it.

342
00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.089
- What does it mean?
- It means a million things.

343
00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:47.925
I don't know.
Get out of my face.

344
00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.860
I don't know
and get out of my face.

345
00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:52.629
It's the best thing Italy
created, except for espresso.

346
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.398
Oh, so you've been
drinking espresso?

347
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.267
Hey. German?
American.

348
00:18:58.269 --> 00:18:59.771
A rose for you.

349
00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:02.705
Whoa.

350
00:19:02.707 --> 00:19:04.273
<i>"Boh"</i> is my
new superpower.

351
00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:06.978
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

352
00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:09.379
So, what's in the bag?

353
00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.346
Oh, uh...

354
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:14.152
Nice.

355
00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:23.461
Whoa, cool.

356
00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.280
What was that?

357
00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.305
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

358
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:08.938
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

359
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.308
Guys, we gotta go!

360
00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:15.678
- What is that?
- I don't know.

361
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.612
- What'll you do?
- My suit's in the hotel.

362
00:20:17.614 --> 00:20:19.148
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

363
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.149
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out.

364
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:22.054
Go! Just go!

365
00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.632
Get out of here. Go!

366
00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.503
Oh, my God.

367
00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:46.575
Come on.

368
00:20:59.824 --> 00:21:00.726
Oh, no, you don't.

369
00:21:11.736 --> 00:21:14.006
You okay?
Get out of here. Go!

370
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.156
Excuse me, sir!

371
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.957
I... I can help.
Let me help.

372
00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.726
I'm really strong,
and I'm sticky.

373
00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.863
I need to lead it away
from the canals.

374
00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.655
The da Vinci Museum.

375
00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.957
This is why
we're here in Venice.

376
00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.557
Oh, this is it.

377
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:43.793
It's closed.

378
00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.661
What do you mean?
Till when?

379
00:22:45.663 --> 00:22:46.762
November.

380
00:22:46.764 --> 00:22:48.331
You didn't check
the website?

381
00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:49.535
Oh, that's
a good idea.

382
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.918
Oh, come on.

383
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.220
Stay low, kids.
We'll be safe here.

384
00:24:10.914 --> 00:24:12.849
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know,

385
00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:14.516
but he's kicking
that water's ass.

386
00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:47.885
Yeah! Yeah!

387
00:25:03.767 --> 00:25:05.301
It's aliens.
It has to be.

388
00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.504
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor,
Morris Bench,

389
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.171
who was exposed
to an experimental

390
00:25:09.173 --> 00:25:11.274
underwater generator
and got hydro powers.

391
00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:12.842
You should
definitely believe

392
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.444
everything
on the Internet.

393
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.947
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

394
00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:20.986
You know,
being a man of science...

395
00:25:22.286 --> 00:25:23.619
witches.

396
00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:25.588
No, no, no.
We wanna stay.

397
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.323
Good thing
I packed your suit, huh?

398
00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:28.823
<i>I can't believe you forgot it.</i>

399
00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:30.258
Yeah.

400
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.826
Who was that guy
you were with?

401
00:25:31.828 --> 00:25:33.095
Was that Mr. Strange?

402
00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:35.997
Doctor Strange, May.
Doctor Strange.

403
00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:37.733
And, no, I don't know
who that was.

404
00:25:37.735 --> 00:25:39.101
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

405
00:25:39.103 --> 00:25:41.236
- I was trying to help him...
- That's my lunch.

406
00:25:41.238 --> 00:25:42.471
Don't eat
that one.

407
00:25:42.473 --> 00:25:43.471
Happy's there?

408
00:25:43.473 --> 00:25:45.608
Yeah, it's Happy.

409
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.842
He's here.
He came by to volunteer.

410
00:25:47.844 --> 00:25:50.112
<i>And he's hanging
around the office.</i>

411
00:25:50.114 --> 00:25:52.614
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want... Hi, Peter.

412
00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:54.051
Hey, Happy.

413
00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:59.688
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

414
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.024
- What are you...?
- <i>Glad you're having a good time.</i>

415
00:26:02.026 --> 00:26:04.028
Don't worry, I'm taking
care of your aunt.

416
00:26:06.963 --> 00:26:09.500
So how's
the plan going?

417
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.669
There's been setbacks,
for sure.

418
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:16.171
Trust your instincts,
you'll be fine.

419
00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:19.008
I know. Love you.
Bye.

420
00:26:20.644 --> 00:26:21.843
Who is that guy?

421
00:26:21.845 --> 00:26:23.746
He's Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

422
00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:26.682
He's all right.
He's no Spider-Man.

423
00:26:26.684 --> 00:26:28.519
What is it with you
and Spider-Man?

424
00:26:29.719 --> 00:26:31.687
What?
He's just awesome, okay?

425
00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:35.123
He protects the neighborhood
and, you know, he's inspiring.

426
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:37.325
He inspires me
to be a better man.

427
00:26:37.327 --> 00:26:39.728
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

428
00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:44.700
Sounds like
his name's Mysterio.

429
00:26:44.702 --> 00:26:46.535
<i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i>

430
00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:48.737
is Italian
for "man of mystery."

431
00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:50.305
They don't know
who he is.

432
00:26:50.307 --> 00:26:51.843
Mysterio.

433
00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.179
Cool name.

434
00:26:55.479 --> 00:26:56.746
Babe.

435
00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.781
So how much of that
did you actually see?

436
00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.850
Not much. I was running.

437
00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.753
Right. Me too.
I was also running...

438
00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.890
away.

439
00:27:06.924 --> 00:27:09.124
So Paris tomorrow.

440
00:27:09.126 --> 00:27:11.861
Go to the Eiffel Tower.
Should be great.

441
00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:14.796
Yeah, I read it was secretly
built as a mind control antenna

442
00:27:14.798 --> 00:27:16.532
to create an army
of the insane.

443
00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.932
Oh.

444
00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:18.935
It's my favorite

445
00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:20.136
destination on the trip.

446
00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:25.807
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

447
00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:27.744
Nothing. It's dead.

448
00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.178
Besides, that Mysterio guy's
all over it.

449
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.047
Look, I just wanna
spend time with MJ.

450
00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:35.050
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

451
00:27:35.052 --> 00:27:36.386
That's nice.

452
00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.588
Reminds me of when
Betty and I fell in love.

453
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.792
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, and...

454
00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:49.801
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

455
00:27:52.903 --> 00:27:54.803
You're Nick Fury.

456
00:27:54.805 --> 00:27:56.372
And you just shot Ned.

457
00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:57.873
It's a mild tranquilizer.

458
00:27:57.875 --> 00:27:58.873
He'll be all right.

459
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:02.011
So good to finally meet you.

460
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.678
I saw you at the funeral,

461
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.448
I didn't think that was
a good time to exchange numbers.

462
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.485
No, that would've
been inappropriate.

463
00:28:08.487 --> 00:28:10.620
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

464
00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.089
The important thing is,
you're here.

465
00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.490
I tried to bring you here.

466
00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:17.459
You avoided me,
and now you're here.

467
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:19.262
What a coincidence.

468
00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.496
Wait. Was this
a coincidence?

469
00:28:21.498 --> 00:28:24.867
I used to know everything.

470
00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:26.703
Then I come back
five years later,

471
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.637
and now I know nothing.

472
00:28:28.639 --> 00:28:31.439
No intel, no team.

473
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:33.743
And a high school kid

474
00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:36.778
is dodging my calls.

475
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.349
Here's what I do know:

476
00:28:41.151 --> 00:28:46.322
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

477
00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:49.825
Witnesses say
that cyclone had a face.

478
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.167
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

479
00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.805
A village was...

480
00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:02.338
Just making the rounds.

481
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.140
See if anyone needs
any counseling

482
00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.807
after today's
traumatic events.

483
00:29:05.809 --> 00:29:08.409
No, we'll be okay.
We're fine. Thank you.

484
00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:11.980
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

485
00:29:11.982 --> 00:29:13.381
Oh, he's passed out.

486
00:29:13.383 --> 00:29:16.454
I'm not qualified to
do it anyway, so good night.

487
00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.355
That was my teacher.
Sorry about that.

488
00:29:20.357 --> 00:29:21.591
You were saying?

489
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.092
A village was
destroyed by what

490
00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.027
may well be
another world-threatening...

491
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.428
Babe, you still awake?

492
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.264
You're not answering
any of my texts.

493
00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:30.032
Um, he's asleep, Betty.

494
00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:31.499
Oh, already?

495
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:33.335
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

496
00:29:33.337 --> 00:29:35.204
That's why
it's imperative...

497
00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:37.573
Hey, boys.
So that canal water today

498
00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.743
was filled
with dangerous bacteria...

499
00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:41.544
Another person
touches that door,

500
00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:43.579
we are going
to attend another funeral.

501
00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.214
- Suit up.
- Let me know if

502
00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.716
either of you
develop vomiting.

503
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.388
Stark left these for you.

504
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.059
Really?

505
00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:09.438
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

506
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.105
Stark said
you wouldn't get that

507
00:30:11.107 --> 00:30:13.609
because it's not
a <i>Star Wars</i> reference.

508
00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:18.915
You can lose the mask.

509
00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.784
Everyone here
has seen you without it.

510
00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:22.450
You'd only be
feigning anonymity

511
00:30:22.452 --> 00:30:25.523
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

512
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.629
Come on.

513
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.632
Yeah.

514
00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:39.003
Over there,
we have Maria Hill.

515
00:30:40.304 --> 00:30:43.604
That is Dimitri.

516
00:30:43.606 --> 00:30:47.077
And this is Mr. Beck.

517
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.446
Mysterio?

518
00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.615
What?

519
00:30:53.949 --> 00:30:54.716
Doesn't matter.
It's what my friends

520
00:30:54.718 --> 00:30:55.918
have been calling you.

521
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.257
Well, you can
call me Quentin.

522
00:31:01.558 --> 00:31:03.626
You handled yourself well
out there today.

523
00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.294
I saw what you did
with the tower.

524
00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:07.362
We could use someone like you
on my world.

525
00:31:07.364 --> 00:31:09.098
Thanks.

526
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.600
I'm sorry. Your world?

527
00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:13.369
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

528
00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.937
Just not yours.

529
00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:16.805
There are multiple realities.

530
00:31:16.807 --> 00:31:20.008
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

531
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.211
I'm sorry, you're saying
there's a multiverse?

532
00:31:23.213 --> 00:31:25.180
'Cause I thought
that was theoretical.

533
00:31:25.182 --> 00:31:27.181
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

534
00:31:27.183 --> 00:31:29.552
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

535
00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.888
How does that even work
with all the quantum...?

536
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.858
It's insane.

537
00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:38.427
S-sorry. It's really cool.

538
00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:42.098
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

539
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.699
Anyway...

540
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:49.839
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

541
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.108
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

542
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.710
Air, water, fire, earth.

543
00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.346
The Science Division had
a technical name.

544
00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:59.515
We just called them
Elementals.

545
00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:02.016
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

546
00:32:02.018 --> 00:32:03.886
Turns out,
the myths are real.

547
00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.786
Like Thor.

548
00:32:05.788 --> 00:32:08.925
Thor was a myth, now I study him
in my physics class.

549
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.426
These myths are threats.

550
00:32:11.428 --> 00:32:14.196
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

551
00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.663
We mobilized
and fought them,

552
00:32:15.665 --> 00:32:18.266
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

553
00:32:18.268 --> 00:32:21.336
I was part of the last battalion
left trying to stop them.

554
00:32:21.338 --> 00:32:23.605
All we did was
delay the inevitable.

555
00:32:23.607 --> 00:32:26.774
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

556
00:32:26.776 --> 00:32:28.244
Our satellites
confirm it.

557
00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:31.046
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

558
00:32:31.048 --> 00:32:32.880
There's only one left:
fire.

559
00:32:32.882 --> 00:32:35.251
The strongest
of them all.

560
00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.755
The one that destroyed
my Earth.

561
00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:40.823
It's the one
that took my family.

562
00:32:44.094 --> 00:32:45.727
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:48.264
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

564
00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:51.167
We have one mission:
kill it.

565
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.403
And you're coming with us.

566
00:32:54.271 --> 00:32:57.172
I'm sorry,
did you say Prague? Heh.

567
00:32:57.174 --> 00:32:59.274
Mr. Fury,
this all seems like bigtime,

568
00:32:59.276 --> 00:33:02.009
you know, huge superhero
kind of stuff.

569
00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:05.581
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

570
00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.448
Bitch, please.
You've been to space.

571
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.083
I know,
but that was an accident.

572
00:33:09.085 --> 00:33:11.088
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

573
00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:14.156
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

574
00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:15.957
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

575
00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:17.592
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

576
00:33:17.594 --> 00:33:19.093
Don't invoke her name.

577
00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:20.928
Sir, look,
I really wanna help. I do.

578
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.799
If my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

579
00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:26.401
If I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

580
00:33:26.403 --> 00:33:28.603
my class will figure out
who I am, and then...

581
00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:30.339
Then the whole world
will figure out

582
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.142
who I am,
then I'm done.

583
00:33:32.776 --> 00:33:34.110
Okay.

584
00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:35.479
I understand.

585
00:33:36.413 --> 00:33:38.080
I'm sorry, what?

586
00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:40.849
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

587
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:43.419
and become suspicious.

588
00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.920
Dimitri.

589
00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:47.255
Take him back to the hotel,
please.

590
00:33:47.257 --> 00:33:48.256
Yes.

591
00:33:48.258 --> 00:33:50.325
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

592
00:33:50.327 --> 00:33:52.393
And, uh, good luck.

593
00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.830
See you, kid.

594
00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:57.501
Yeah, see you.

595
00:33:58.969 --> 00:34:01.339
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

596
00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.442
Okay, drink lots
of water.

597
00:34:07.444 --> 00:34:09.344
I'm gonna get you
a vitamin C pill.

598
00:34:09.346 --> 00:34:12.313
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

599
00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:14.183
Hey, man, are you sure
you're good?

600
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.717
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

601
00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.219
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

602
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.821
Seriously, getting tranq'd
in the neck by Nick Fury,

603
00:34:19.823 --> 00:34:22.190
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

604
00:34:22.192 --> 00:34:23.558
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

605
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.493
I'm happy I don't have
to go to Prague.

606
00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:26.795
- Seriously.
- Good news.

607
00:34:26.797 --> 00:34:29.330
We're going to Prague. Huh?

608
00:34:29.332 --> 00:34:30.899
- What?
- Prague?

609
00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:33.335
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

610
00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.571
You should've heard me
on the phone with them.

611
00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.038
I really gave them hell.

612
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.507
All I heard was
crying.

613
00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.009
Look at
our upgraded ride. Huh?

614
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.208
Whoa, bro,
you see that?

615
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.478
It's pretty sick.

616
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.446
I'm impressed,
Mr. Harrington.

617
00:34:44.448 --> 00:34:46.114
Oh, come on.

618
00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:49.618
Peter, what...?
What's going on?

619
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.054
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

620
00:34:53.056 --> 00:34:56.491
I'm, uh, Mr. Harrington
to the kids...

621
00:34:56.493 --> 00:34:58.226
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

622
00:34:58.228 --> 00:34:59.431
Awesome.

623
00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:03.031
Yeah. Awesome.

624
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:28.089
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

625
00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:30.894
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

626
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.183
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you.

627
00:35:55.185 --> 00:35:56.788
Say EDITH."

628
00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:02.091
<i>Stand by for
retinal and biometric scan.</i>

629
00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:04.259
<i>Retinal and biometric scan
accepted.</i>

630
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:06.594
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>

631
00:36:06.596 --> 00:36:08.563
<i>I am EDITH, Tony Stark's</i>

632
00:36:08.565 --> 00:36:11.766
<i>augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

633
00:36:11.768 --> 00:36:14.569
- So he made you for me?
- <i>No. But you have access</i>

634
00:36:14.571 --> 00:36:16.772
- <i>to all of Tony's protocols.</i>
- Cool.

635
00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.841
<i>Would you like
to see what I can do?</i>

636
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:28.250
<i>EDITH stands for
"Even dead, I'm the hero."</i>

637
00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.817
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

638
00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:32.455
- Yeah, he did.
- <i>I have access to</i>

639
00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:34.690
<i>the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

640
00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.759
<i>including multiple
defense satellites,</i>

641
00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.326
<i>as well as back doors</i>

642
00:36:38.328 --> 00:36:40.198
<i>to all major
telecommunication networks.</i>

643
00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.200
Whoa.

644
00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:48.339
Is MJ texting?

645
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.074
No. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

646
00:36:53.076 --> 00:36:55.143
That's wrong. That's wrong.

647
00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:15.129
Petrol and toilets.
Ten minutes!

648
00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:17.299
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

649
00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.667
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

650
00:37:19.669 --> 00:37:21.368
Ten minutes,
everyone.

651
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.508
Dimitri,
where exactly are we?

652
00:37:26.643 --> 00:37:27.875
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

653
00:37:27.877 --> 00:37:29.176
Oh, my gosh,
it's so sick.

654
00:37:29.178 --> 00:37:31.379
It's beautiful.

655
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:32.683
What?

656
00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:46.661
Hello.

657
00:37:46.663 --> 00:37:47.899
Close the door.

658
00:37:51.868 --> 00:37:53.868
Um...

659
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.237
I'm Peter Parker.

660
00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:57.075
Take off your clothes.

661
00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.841
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

662
00:37:59.843 --> 00:38:02.310
Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

663
00:38:02.312 --> 00:38:04.281
So I made you this,
another suit.

664
00:38:05.681 --> 00:38:08.417
Oh, uh, thank you.

665
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.652
I'm sure it fits fine.
I don't need to try...

666
00:38:10.654 --> 00:38:13.091
- Take off your clothes.
- Okay.

667
00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.094
Sure.

668
00:38:17.727 --> 00:38:19.828
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

669
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.799
This is weird. Heh.

670
00:38:24.868 --> 00:38:26.400
No, no, no. Don't...

671
00:38:26.402 --> 00:38:27.638
Whoa.

672
00:38:28.605 --> 00:38:29.904
Uh...

673
00:38:29.906 --> 00:38:31.940
Sorry. I thought
this was the bathroom.

674
00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:33.542
This is not
what it looks like.

675
00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:34.909
- Just...
- Yeah.

676
00:38:34.911 --> 00:38:36.946
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

677
00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:38.714
Oh, my God.
Don't shoot anybody.

678
00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.815
Brad? It's not what
it looks like, buddy.

679
00:38:40.817 --> 00:38:42.817
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

680
00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:45.085
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

681
00:38:45.087 --> 00:38:47.788
If you want to hook up with
some random European chick,

682
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.759
- that's on you.
- That's not what that was.

683
00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:51.725
I can't pretend
I didn't see what I saw.

684
00:38:51.727 --> 00:38:54.196
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

685
00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:56.364
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

686
00:38:56.366 --> 00:38:58.400
You cannot show her
that photo, dude.

687
00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:00.268
I'm sorry, man.
I have to.

688
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.571
She deserves the truth.

689
00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:05.141
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

690
00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:07.074
and, everybody,
back on the bus.

691
00:39:07.076 --> 00:39:09.080
It's been 10 minutes.
Let's go!

692
00:39:13.783 --> 00:39:16.283
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

693
00:39:16.285 --> 00:39:18.053
- EDITH?
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>

694
00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:20.054
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Hey. There's this guy

695
00:39:20.056 --> 00:39:22.056
in my class who's gonna
ruin everything...

696
00:39:22.058 --> 00:39:24.391
<i>Peter,
I'm having difficulty hearing you.</i>

697
00:39:24.393 --> 00:39:25.828
<i>Can you please speak up?</i>

698
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.330
Um, Brad Davis.
He has a photo of me.

699
00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:30.466
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

700
00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:31.803
Is Brad a target? Um...

701
00:39:37.006 --> 00:39:39.174
Yeah. He's a target.
He's a target.

702
00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.775
<i>Copy that.</i>

703
00:39:40.777 --> 00:39:43.478
<i>Target is Brad Davis.
Initiating strike.</i>

704
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.846
Initiating what, now?

705
00:39:44.848 --> 00:39:46.547
<i>Intercept point determined.</i>

706
00:39:46.549 --> 00:39:48.116
- <i>Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.

707
00:40:11.674 --> 00:40:13.708
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

708
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.044
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

709
00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:19.214
- I'm paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...

710
00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:20.418
I'm so sorry.

711
00:40:22.786 --> 00:40:23.984
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

712
00:40:23.986 --> 00:40:25.487
<i>Do you want me to cancel</i>

713
00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.987
<i>the drone strike
on Brad Davis?</i>

714
00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:28.390
- Did you just punch Flash?
- No.

715
00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:29.292
<i>Firing.</i>

716
00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.928
Oh, look out!

717
00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.167
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

718
00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:40.734
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

719
00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:43.039
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

720
00:40:44.674 --> 00:40:46.341
<i>Commencing second strike.</i>

721
00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.243
Peter. Plant your fanny
and buckle up.

722
00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.844
Look at
the baby mountain goats!

723
00:40:49.846 --> 00:40:52.547
- Baby mountain goats?
- Ooh, I see them.

724
00:41:06.062 --> 00:41:08.364
I don't see
any mountain goats.

725
00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:09.897
You missed them.

726
00:41:09.899 --> 00:41:12.400
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

727
00:41:12.402 --> 00:41:13.835
What?

728
00:41:13.837 --> 00:41:16.404
...but your new look,
I love it.

729
00:41:16.406 --> 00:41:18.406
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

730
00:41:18.408 --> 00:41:21.377
Yeah. Sophisticated,
classy, very European.

731
00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:22.509
Oh, man.

732
00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.714
Let's try that again.

733
00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:29.083
Uh, this is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

734
00:41:29.085 --> 00:41:32.122
- I-I...
- Yeah. Weird.

735
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.960
Ow.

736
00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:04.085
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

737
00:42:04.087 --> 00:42:06.589
Wow, this place
is so classy.

738
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:08.156
Yeah, so why
are we here?

739
00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:09.958
Speak for yourself.

740
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.592
I'm home.

741
00:42:11.594 --> 00:42:13.261
What can I say?

742
00:42:13.263 --> 00:42:15.596
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

743
00:42:15.598 --> 00:42:19.301
Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

744
00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:21.902
is Prague's annual...

745
00:42:21.904 --> 00:42:23.504
- ...Carnival of Lights.
- Yeah!

746
00:42:23.506 --> 00:42:25.107
- Hello?
- <i>Parker, it's Hill.</i>

747
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.808
<i>There's an earpiece
with your suit.</i>

748
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.810
<i>Put it on and await
further instructions.</i>

749
00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.145
- <i>Understood?</i>
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

750
00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:31.513
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.

751
00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.848
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

752
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.484
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

753
00:42:36.486 --> 00:42:38.053
I'm still your guy
in the chair.

754
00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.054
No, it's all good.
Don't worry about it.

755
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:42.690
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

756
00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:45.125
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

757
00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:47.661
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh, here in the city.

758
00:42:47.663 --> 00:42:50.065
- Peter, we're here.
- I know, I know. It's not good.

759
00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.466
It's... I'm figuring it out.

760
00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.534
You have to do something,
Peter, please.

761
00:42:53.536 --> 00:42:54.902
We're all counting on you.

762
00:42:54.904 --> 00:42:56.871
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

763
00:42:56.873 --> 00:42:59.708
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

764
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.509
- It's about time.
- Serious?

765
00:43:01.511 --> 00:43:04.011
- <i>Parker? Parker!</i>
- Yes, sir.

766
00:43:04.013 --> 00:43:06.380
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

767
00:43:06.382 --> 00:43:08.348
- Are we boring you?
- He's not bored.

768
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.451
He's thinking about
how you kidnapped him.

769
00:43:10.453 --> 00:43:12.053
He had obstacles.

770
00:43:12.055 --> 00:43:14.022
I removed them.

771
00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.957
They still won't
evacuate the city.

772
00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:18.627
Idiots.

773
00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.495
So, what's the plan,
Parker?

774
00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:22.998
I will be in
the cathedral tower,

775
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.699
keeping watch
for the fire monster.

776
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:27.301
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

777
00:43:27.303 --> 00:43:30.740
- and then Mr. Beck and I will...
- My name is Mysterio.

778
00:43:33.509 --> 00:43:36.009
That's when Mysterio and I
will move in.

779
00:43:36.011 --> 00:43:37.411
Peter, listen to me.

780
00:43:37.413 --> 00:43:40.082
The best hope you have,
the only hope,

781
00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:43.618
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

782
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.754
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

783
00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:48.723
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

784
00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:50.692
If it gets too big,
it'll be able to

785
00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.361
draw power
from the Earth's core.

786
00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:55.600
After that,
there's no way to stop it.

787
00:43:59.402 --> 00:44:01.069
Hey, my friends are here.

788
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.638
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

789
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.841
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

790
00:44:06.843 --> 00:44:11.946
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

791
00:44:11.948 --> 00:44:15.382
Stark gave you
a multibillion-dollar

792
00:44:15.384 --> 00:44:17.719
A.R. tactical
intelligence system,

793
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.388
and the first thing
you do with it

794
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.955
is try and blow up
your friends.

795
00:44:20.957 --> 00:44:25.930
It's clear to me that
you were not ready for this.

796
00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:34.969
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

797
00:44:34.971 --> 00:44:37.138
He just... He felt bad
about snapping at you.

798
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.605
Really?

799
00:44:38.607 --> 00:44:41.176
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

800
00:44:42.678 --> 00:44:43.947
How you feeling?

801
00:44:46.348 --> 00:44:48.650
Uh...

802
00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:52.020
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

803
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.624
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

804
00:44:56.359 --> 00:44:59.861
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

805
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:02.700
and now it's all ruined.

806
00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:12.509
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

807
00:45:14.076 --> 00:45:15.576
It's a hard path.

808
00:45:15.578 --> 00:45:17.946
You see things.
You do things.

809
00:45:17.948 --> 00:45:19.216
You make choices.

810
00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.152
People look up to you...

811
00:45:23.853 --> 00:45:26.223
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

812
00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.326
I like you, Peter.
You're a good kid.

813
00:45:31.093 --> 00:45:34.696
There's a part of me that
wants me to tell you, just...

814
00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.630
turn around,
run away from all this.

815
00:45:36.632 --> 00:45:38.299
Then there's
another part of me

816
00:45:38.301 --> 00:45:40.502
that knows what
we're about to fight,

817
00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:43.908
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

818
00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:46.475
Me too.

819
00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.842
But you're worried about
your friends.

820
00:45:48.844 --> 00:45:50.712
Yeah.

821
00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:53.649
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

822
00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:56.250
Look,
just get them inside

823
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:58.752
and keep them in a safe place
for just a few hours.

824
00:45:58.754 --> 00:45:59.789
They'll be all right.

825
00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:04.359
It's really nice to have
somebody to talk to

826
00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:06.297
about superhero stuff,
you know?

827
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.364
Anytime.

828
00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:12.033
And, hey,
we survive this,

829
00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:14.067
you'll have all summer
to kill Brad.

830
00:46:17.573 --> 00:46:19.073
See you out there.

831
00:46:19.075 --> 00:46:20.009
All right.

832
00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.346
<i>Scusi.</i>

833
00:46:25.348 --> 00:46:28.315
Sorry, that's Italian.

834
00:46:30.152 --> 00:46:33.487
Okay. EDITH?
Oh, come on.

835
00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:35.357
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey, uh...

836
00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:38.225
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

837
00:46:38.227 --> 00:46:39.893
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

838
00:46:39.895 --> 00:46:41.629
Good news.

839
00:46:41.631 --> 00:46:43.297
We're going to the opera!

840
00:46:43.299 --> 00:46:44.966
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

841
00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:46.134
Don't look at me.

842
00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:47.636
What happened
to the carnival?

843
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.370
This is upgrade living, guys.

844
00:46:49.372 --> 00:46:53.208
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

845
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.243
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

846
00:46:56.245 --> 00:47:00.714
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

847
00:47:00.716 --> 00:47:03.750
Uh, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

848
00:47:03.752 --> 00:47:05.319
Thank you, Ned.

849
00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:08.422
Everyone,
this is gonna be, maybe,

850
00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:11.292
the best four hours
of our whole trip.

851
00:47:11.294 --> 00:47:12.794
Four hours?

852
00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:15.397
Guys, I think this
is gonna be fun. Seriously.

853
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.902
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

854
00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:23.571
Yeah, because we'd much
rather go to a four-hour opera

855
00:47:23.573 --> 00:47:25.640
instead of the biggest party
in the world.

856
00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:28.243
Again,
don't look at me.

857
00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:30.078
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

858
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.348
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

859
00:47:33.482 --> 00:47:35.716
Okay, here we are.

860
00:47:35.718 --> 00:47:37.419
Beat the rush.

861
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.054
Yeah, the rush out.

862
00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:42.259
Lucky for us, we got
the best seats in the house.

863
00:47:43.426 --> 00:47:44.361
Let's go.

864
00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.864
Hey.
I'll save you a seat.

865
00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.705
You look really pretty.

866
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.538
And therefore,
I have value?

867
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.509
No. No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...

868
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.976
I'm messing with you.

869
00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:06.013
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

870
00:48:06.015 --> 00:48:09.049
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

871
00:48:09.051 --> 00:48:11.652
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

872
00:48:11.654 --> 00:48:13.487
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

873
00:48:13.489 --> 00:48:15.757
Want to go in on a pair?

874
00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.357
You mean,
sit next to each other?

875
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:18.692
Yeah.

876
00:48:18.694 --> 00:48:20.529
<i>Are you in position?</i>

877
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:22.096
- No.
- Okay. No...

878
00:48:22.098 --> 00:48:23.632
<i>Why the hell not? Parker?</i>

879
00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.266
You don't want to
sit next to me,

880
00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:27.201
or, no, you just
don't want the glasses?

881
00:48:27.203 --> 00:48:28.937
I didn't mean that.
Uh, uh...

882
00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:31.308
If you go ahead,
I'll go grab us a pair.

883
00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.342
I'll save you
a seat next to me.

884
00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:35.611
Awesome.

885
00:48:35.613 --> 00:48:37.879
A lot of seats,
so I'll be up there.

886
00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.080
Okay.

887
00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:41.882
- <i>Parker.</i>
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

888
00:48:41.884 --> 00:48:44.351
Hey, I gotta go.
Could you tell MJ

889
00:48:44.353 --> 00:48:46.254
that I'm sick
or something?

890
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.190
Okay. Be careful.

891
00:48:48.192 --> 00:48:49.857
And Peter,
whatever you do,

892
00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:52.359
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

893
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:54.161
Yeah, Ned, I know.

894
00:48:54.163 --> 00:48:55.196
- Okay.
- Okay?

895
00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.733
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

896
00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:14.882
<i>Parker!
You better be on your way.</i>

897
00:49:14.884 --> 00:49:16.016
Coming.

898
00:49:22.158 --> 00:49:24.525
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

899
00:49:24.527 --> 00:49:26.995
- Oh, I... I don't...
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

900
00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:30.397
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

901
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:47.415
All right. I'm in position.

902
00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.216
Uh, as soon as
I see something,

903
00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:51.384
Beck, I'll, uh...
I'll let you know.

904
00:49:51.386 --> 00:49:53.554
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- <i>How's the suit?</i>

905
00:49:53.556 --> 00:49:55.790
Ah, the suit's great.
It's awesome.

906
00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:58.125
It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

907
00:49:58.127 --> 00:50:00.161
- <i>Parker!</i>
- Okay, I'll shut up.

908
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.763
Oh, my God, babe,
isn't this beautiful?

909
00:50:02.765 --> 00:50:05.167
Yeah, it's real beautiful,
babe.

910
00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:08.502
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just...

911
00:50:08.504 --> 00:50:11.138
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

912
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.408
I have the perfect thing.
Come on.

913
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.777
Heh.

914
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:24.085
Don't worry, babe.

915
00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:26.587
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

916
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:28.292
You'll feel
a thousand times better.

917
00:50:33.395 --> 00:50:34.629
Energy spiking.

918
00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:35.964
We have seismic activity.

919
00:50:47.576 --> 00:50:50.444
Okay, he's here! Beck, are you
ready? You know what to do.

920
00:50:50.446 --> 00:50:52.849
On your lead, Spider-Man.

921
00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.353
No, come back!

922
00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:00.924
Come back and help us!

923
00:51:07.663 --> 00:51:08.866
You're up, kid.

924
00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.176
Wait, wait. Is that...?

925
00:51:23.178 --> 00:51:24.712
Do you think
that's Spider-Man?

926
00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:25.980
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

927
00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.949
It's a European
rip-off version of him.

928
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.820
I actually read about him.
It's not him.

929
00:51:43.466 --> 00:51:45.533
No, Beck!
He's got the carousel!

930
00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:47.368
He's getting bigger!

931
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.203
What's his name?
What's his name?

932
00:51:49.205 --> 00:51:50.871
Uh, it's Night...
Night Monkey.

933
00:51:50.873 --> 00:51:52.373
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

934
00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:54.007
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

935
00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:56.076
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

936
00:51:56.078 --> 00:51:57.344
- Save us!
- What?

937
00:51:57.346 --> 00:51:59.013
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

938
00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.783
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

939
00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:15.998
Are you okay?

940
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.368
On to Plan B?

941
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:24.038
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

942
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.507
I go left,
you go right! Now!

943
00:52:42.357 --> 00:52:43.623
Okay, shoot him!

944
00:52:43.625 --> 00:52:45.025
Yeah!

945
00:52:47.096 --> 00:52:49.332
That hurt him.
Keep it coming.

946
00:52:57.406 --> 00:52:59.341
<i>Spider-Man,
keep your distance.</i>

947
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:01.241
<i>I'm trying!</i>

948
00:53:01.243 --> 00:53:03.578
<i>Can't let him get
near the Ferris wheel.</i>

949
00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.179
<i>Okay. I'm on it!</i>

950
00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.493
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

951
00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.973
Whoa, what is that?!

952
00:53:37.413 --> 00:53:38.815
Betty! Betty!

953
00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:02.372
That's it! Nice!
Nice! You got him!

954
00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.681
No, no, no.

955
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.255
It's too late.

956
00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.721
Whatever happens...

957
00:54:21.723 --> 00:54:23.424
I'm glad we met.

958
00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.194
Beck,
what are you doing?

959
00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:28.864
What I should have done
last time.

960
00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:34.871
Beck, don't do it!

961
00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.741
Beck!

962
00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.498
Mr. Beck?

963
00:55:05.234 --> 00:55:06.602
Oh, thank God.

964
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.743
I would totally kiss you,

965
00:55:16.745 --> 00:55:19.115
but I think I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

966
00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:24.187
I might have a mint.

967
00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:27.120
So it's over?

968
00:55:27.122 --> 00:55:28.955
That was the last of them.

969
00:55:28.957 --> 00:55:32.125
But not the last threat
we'll ever face.

970
00:55:32.127 --> 00:55:35.795
We need to stay vigilant.

971
00:55:35.797 --> 00:55:38.399
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

972
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:42.370
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

973
00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:44.007
You should join us.

974
00:55:45.607 --> 00:55:48.344
Thank you. I just might
take you up on that.

975
00:55:57.953 --> 00:56:01.989
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

976
00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.190
Mr. Fury, I...

977
00:56:03.192 --> 00:56:05.926
I'd love to have you
in Berlin too.

978
00:56:05.928 --> 00:56:10.998
But you got to decide whether
you're going to step up or not.

979
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.699
Stark chose you.

980
00:56:12.701 --> 00:56:15.536
He made you an Avenger.

981
00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.638
I need that.

982
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.007
The world needs that.

983
00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:22.746
Maybe Stark was wrong.

984
00:56:25.614 --> 00:56:26.750
Was he?

985
00:56:28.884 --> 00:56:30.951
The choice is yours.

986
00:56:45.134 --> 00:56:47.036
Let's get a drink.

987
00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.471
I'm not 21.

988
00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.850
Hey.

989
00:57:02.151 --> 00:57:04.919
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

990
00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.223
Yeah.

991
00:57:07.256 --> 00:57:09.223
Fury was right.

992
00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:11.759
Tony did a lot
for me...

993
00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.862
so I owe it to him,
to everybody.

994
00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:15.830
Do you?

995
00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.768
Yeah. I mean...

996
00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:22.370
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

997
00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:24.203
He wanted me to be
better than him.

998
00:57:24.205 --> 00:57:26.274
And Fury just wants me
to live up to that.

999
00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.841
What do you want, Peter?

1000
00:57:27.843 --> 00:57:30.578
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

1001
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.879
I don't know.

1002
00:57:32.881 --> 00:57:34.681
What do you want?
Peter Parker. Now.

1003
00:57:34.683 --> 00:57:36.250
I know you're
thinking about it.

1004
00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.685
I wanna go on my trip,
right?

1005
00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.888
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

1006
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:43.056
And go to
the top of the Eiffel Tower

1007
00:57:43.058 --> 00:57:46.395
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

1008
00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:50.364
- and give her a kiss.
- Whoa.

1009
00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.031
Shut up, man.

1010
00:57:52.033 --> 00:57:53.701
You're not gonna do that,
are you?

1011
00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.435
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

1012
00:57:55.437 --> 00:57:57.540
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

1013
00:57:59.942 --> 00:58:02.277
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

1014
00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:04.112
- Are those the...?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

1015
00:58:04.114 --> 00:58:05.779
They were just
on the floor?

1016
00:58:05.781 --> 00:58:07.614
Try them on.
Let's see how they look.

1017
00:58:07.616 --> 00:58:08.584
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1018
00:58:12.254 --> 00:58:14.254
I actually
really like them.

1019
00:58:14.256 --> 00:58:15.656
Can I be
completely honest?

1020
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.790
Please.

1021
00:58:16.792 --> 00:58:18.625
They look really stupid.

1022
00:58:18.627 --> 00:58:20.060
Oh.

1023
00:58:20.062 --> 00:58:22.395
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

1024
00:58:22.397 --> 00:58:23.931
You try them on.

1025
00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.732
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

1026
00:58:25.734 --> 00:58:27.837
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

1027
00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:37.447
What do you think, kid?

1028
00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:45.051
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1029
00:58:45.053 --> 00:58:47.453
"For the next Tony
Stark, I trust you."

1030
00:58:47.455 --> 00:58:48.955
What?

1031
00:58:48.957 --> 00:58:51.091
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

1032
00:58:51.093 --> 00:58:52.993
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you."

1033
00:58:52.995 --> 00:58:55.830
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

1034
00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.598
He knew every mistake
I ever made.

1035
00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.333
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

1036
00:59:00.335 --> 00:59:01.736
Why would
he give it to you?

1037
00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:03.638
Maybe he didn't trust me
to have EDITH,

1038
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.505
he just trusted me
to pick who should.

1039
00:59:05.507 --> 00:59:08.176
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

1040
00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:09.777
He's not gonna
give them to Fury

1041
00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:11.645
because Fury would
give himself EDITH.

1042
00:59:11.647 --> 00:59:13.147
You're probably right.

1043
00:59:13.149 --> 00:59:16.384
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

1044
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:19.453
And it's not me. I'm
a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1045
00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:22.355
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

1046
00:59:22.357 --> 00:59:25.393
and that's good
like Tony Stark, like you.

1047
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:28.398
No. Peter, come on. No.

1048
00:59:30.866 --> 00:59:32.199
- EDITH?
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>

1049
00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:34.734
Hi. Yeah, um...

1050
00:59:34.736 --> 00:59:37.971
I'd like to transfer your
control over to Quentin Beck.

1051
00:59:37.973 --> 00:59:40.708
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

1052
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.942
<i>Any transfer will
require confirmation.</i>

1053
00:59:42.944 --> 00:59:44.846
Stark gave you
the glasses.

1054
00:59:44.848 --> 00:59:46.212
Stark gave me a choice.

1055
00:59:46.214 --> 00:59:48.348
It's my choice to make.
I'm gonna make it.

1056
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.051
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

1057
00:59:51.053 --> 00:59:53.853
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

1058
00:59:53.855 --> 00:59:55.556
He'd want you to have them.

1059
00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.190
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

1060
00:59:57.192 --> 00:59:58.562
Confirm.

1061
01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.663
Welcome to the Avengers.

1062
01:00:12.007 --> 01:00:13.076
They look good on you.

1063
01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:15.779
Thank you.

1064
01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:17.911
It's an honor.

1065
01:00:17.913 --> 01:00:20.513
Yeah.

1066
01:00:20.515 --> 01:00:22.718
Mr. Stark would've
really liked you.

1067
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.286
- Where you headed?
- I'm gonna go find MJ.

1068
01:00:26.288 --> 01:00:29.123
Good luck, kid. I'll give you
a fifty-fifty chance.

1069
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.257
You're pretty awkward.

1070
01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:33.192
Yeah.

1071
01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:35.598
- See you later, man.
- See you.

1072
01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:09.096
See?
That wasn't so hard.

1073
01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.265
Yes!

1074
01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:14.167
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

1075
01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.578
Okay, we got EDITH. Get these
connected to our system.

1076
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.980
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

1077
01:01:26.982 --> 01:01:29.750
This is a big win, but we still
got a lot of work to do.

1078
01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.585
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

1079
01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.353
Yeah!

1080
01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.823
Okay, toasts!

1081
01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.123
Give me that, Doug.

1082
01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:39.259
To the man
who brought us all together,

1083
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:41.027
our former boss,
Tony Stark.

1084
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:42.429
Boo!

1085
01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:44.132
The jester king.

1086
01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:48.734
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

1087
01:01:48.736 --> 01:01:50.770
that he was unfit to wield.

1088
01:01:50.772 --> 01:01:53.172
Like the holographic system
I designed.

1089
01:01:53.174 --> 01:01:54.609
A revolutionary breakthrough

1090
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:57.109
with limitless applications
that Tony turned

1091
01:01:57.111 --> 01:01:59.179
into a self-therapy machine
and renamed...

1092
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:02.817
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1093
01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.788
Oh, $611 million

1094
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.957
for my little
therapeutic experiment.

1095
01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:13.527
<i>He renamed my life's work...</i>

1096
01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:14.627
"BARF."

1097
01:02:14.629 --> 01:02:16.129
<i>I told him it was a mistake,</i>

1098
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:18.835
that my technology
could change the world.

1099
01:02:19.868 --> 01:02:21.969
And then...

1100
01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.206
he fired me.

1101
01:02:24.573 --> 01:02:26.575
Said I was...

1102
01:02:27.475 --> 01:02:28.911
unstable.

1103
01:02:30.312 --> 01:02:31.377
To Tony.

1104
01:02:31.379 --> 01:02:33.080
To Tony!

1105
01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.748
Next, to William.

1106
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.750
William!

1107
01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:40.587
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1108
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:43.257
With a box of scraps!

1109
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.225
The integration
of my illusion tech

1110
01:02:45.227 --> 01:02:47.361
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

1111
01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:49.996
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

1112
01:02:49.998 --> 01:02:51.399
And it's just the beginning.

1113
01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.466
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

1114
01:02:53.468 --> 01:02:54.801
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

1115
01:02:54.803 --> 01:02:56.469
The story you created
of a soldier

1116
01:02:56.471 --> 01:02:58.205
from another Earth
named Quentin

1117
01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.973
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

1118
01:03:00.975 --> 01:03:04.078
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

1119
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.712
I mean,
everybody bought it.

1120
01:03:05.714 --> 01:03:07.214
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

1121
01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.150
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

1122
01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.585
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

1123
01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.987
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

1124
01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:15.422
Inspired idea.

1125
01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.725
- To Janice.
- Janice!

1126
01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.594
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

1127
01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:24.263
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

1128
01:03:24.265 --> 01:03:25.433
but to a child.

1129
01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:27.100
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

1130
01:03:27.102 --> 01:03:30.036
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

1131
01:03:30.038 --> 01:03:33.040
There's a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

1132
01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.775
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

1133
01:03:35.777 --> 01:03:38.112
the most qualified,
and no one cares.

1134
01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.047
Unless you're flying around
with a cape

1135
01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.748
or shooting lasers
from your hands,

1136
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.953
no one will even listen.

1137
01:03:46.388 --> 01:03:49.857
Well, I've got a cape
and lasers.

1138
01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.027
With our technology
and with EDITH,

1139
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:57.931
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

1140
01:03:57.933 --> 01:03:59.098
Yeah!

1141
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.604
Then everyone will listen!

1142
01:04:03.638 --> 01:04:06.440
Not to a boozy man-child.

1143
01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.208
No!

1144
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.777
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1145
01:04:10.779 --> 01:04:12.980
No!

1146
01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.147
To me...

1147
01:04:14.149 --> 01:04:17.451
and to my very wealthy crew.

1148
01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.717
To us.

1149
01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:19.786
To us.

1150
01:04:19.788 --> 01:04:21.154
To Mysterio!

1151
01:04:21.156 --> 01:04:22.855
To Mysterio!

1152
01:04:22.857 --> 01:04:24.091
To Peter Parker.

1153
01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.795
To Peter Parker!

1154
01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.731
Poor kid.

1155
01:04:29.864 --> 01:04:31.734
Let's get to work.

1156
01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.370
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

1157
01:04:37.372 --> 01:04:38.504
We almost died.

1158
01:04:38.506 --> 01:04:39.705
It's fine. It's fine.

1159
01:04:39.707 --> 01:04:41.542
Hey,
I'm done with the mission.

1160
01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.877
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

1161
01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:46.045
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

1162
01:04:46.047 --> 01:04:47.848
Of course our parents
want us home.

1163
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.716
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1164
01:04:50.718 --> 01:04:53.087
Oh, my God.
Yes, good. Stay here.

1165
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.589
Don't... Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.

1166
01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:58.257
We came for science, we're
leaving because of witches.

1167
01:04:58.259 --> 01:04:59.962
Welcome
to the new Dark Ages.

1168
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:04.498
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

1169
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.866
No, no, no.
All the Elementals are gone.

1170
01:05:06.868 --> 01:05:08.835
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

1171
01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:12.642
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1172
01:05:13.674 --> 01:05:15.344
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1173
01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.846
- Hey.
- Where were you?

1174
01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.846
Um, I got lost.

1175
01:05:20.848 --> 01:05:22.348
We were worried
about you.

1176
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.583
Oh.

1177
01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:25.252
Good thing you're back.
Hm.

1178
01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.719
Yeah.

1179
01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:28.221
So much for Paris,
right?

1180
01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:29.556
It would've been fun.

1181
01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.525
Yeah. Night.

1182
01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:32.795
Night.

1183
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.562
You look ni...

1184
01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:43.538
Okay.

1185
01:05:45.006 --> 01:05:46.038
- Oh.
- Hey.

1186
01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.674
Hey.

1187
01:05:47.676 --> 01:05:49.909
Uh, look, um...

1188
01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:52.446
I'm not ready for this trip
to be over yet,

1189
01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.815
and I kind of want
to do something fun

1190
01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:57.652
that's not on the itinerary
or planned

1191
01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:58.819
or with Mr. Harrington.

1192
01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.654
Yes.

1193
01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.855
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1194
01:06:02.857 --> 01:06:03.959
Yes.

1195
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.995
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1196
01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.765
Meet me outside
in five minutes.

1197
01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.498
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1198
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.138
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Heh.

1199
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.544
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1200
01:06:29.817 --> 01:06:30.884
- Hey.
- Hey.

1201
01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:32.319
So where do
you wanna go?

1202
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.154
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1203
01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.955
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1204
01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.897
I'm glad we're doing this.

1205
01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:46.299
- Yeah, me too.
- To see the city a bit.

1206
01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:49.837
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1207
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.004
- Oh.
- They would put them in a basket,

1208
01:06:52.006 --> 01:06:54.109
and they would drown
in the water.

1209
01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:57.779
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1210
01:06:59.247 --> 01:07:01.380
Uh...

1211
01:07:01.382 --> 01:07:03.716
There's this thing
I've been wanting

1212
01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:06.688
to talk to you about
for a while.

1213
01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:09.826
Yeah?

1214
01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.658
It's our last night
in Europe,

1215
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.563
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1216
01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.397
I'm just gonna tell you.

1217
01:07:18.399 --> 01:07:20.333
Uh...

1218
01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:21.567
MJ, I...

1219
01:07:21.569 --> 01:07:22.537
"I'm Spider-Man."

1220
01:07:24.272 --> 01:07:26.105
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1221
01:07:26.107 --> 01:07:27.609
That you're Spider-Man.

1222
01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:31.545
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1223
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.714
I mean, I've been watching you
for a while now.

1224
01:07:34.716 --> 01:07:38.118
It's kind of obvious.
Heh.

1225
01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.687
I'm not Spider-Man.
What would make you think

1226
01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.821
that I was Spider-Man?

1227
01:07:41.823 --> 01:07:43.958
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1228
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.661
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1229
01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.629
No, I was sick. Remember?

1230
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:51.531
- I had my... The tummy?
- Susan Yang thinks

1231
01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:53.132
- you're a male escort.
- What?

1232
01:07:53.134 --> 01:07:55.868
- Of course I'm not a male escort.
- Then you're Spider-Man.

1233
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:59.004
- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.
- What about tonight?

1234
01:07:59.006 --> 01:08:01.374
You snuck off and fought
that thing. I saw you.

1235
01:08:01.376 --> 01:08:03.878
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1236
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.478
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1237
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.015
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1238
01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:10.116
That's what it said
on the news,

1239
01:08:10.118 --> 01:08:12.388
and the news never lies.

1240
01:08:13.688 --> 01:08:15.188
Night Monkey. Okay.

1241
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:16.559
What are you doing?

1242
01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.392
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man

1243
01:08:20.394 --> 01:08:21.897
use the same webs?

1244
01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:24.464
I mean, maybe.

1245
01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:27.402
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1246
01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.772
Were you only watching me

1247
01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.943
because you thought
I was Spider-Man?

1248
01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.745
Yeah.

1249
01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:41.651
Why else
would I be watching you?

1250
01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:46.456
Doesn't matter.
Just thought that maybe...

1251
01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:53.996
What the hell was that?

1252
01:08:55.864 --> 01:08:57.630
I don't know.

1253
01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:10.777
What is it, some kind
of projector or something?

1254
01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:14.181
Yeah,
but it's really advanced.

1255
01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:16.548
It... It looked so real.

1256
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.886
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1257
01:09:19.888 --> 01:09:23.089
- Wait, does that mean that...?
- The Elementals are fake?

1258
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:26.627
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1259
01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.631
There was fire
and destruction, and...

1260
01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.503
Who would do something
like that?

1261
01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:44.147
Mysterio.

1262
01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.984
I am Spider-Man.

1263
01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.319
And I've really messed up.

1264
01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:54.954
Wait. You're b-being
serious right now?

1265
01:09:54.956 --> 01:09:56.923
- Mm-hm.
- You're 100 percent serious?

1266
01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:59.092
- Because it's not funny.
- No, I'm not joking.

1267
01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:01.360
Because I was only
like 67 percent sure.

1268
01:10:01.362 --> 01:10:03.030
- MJ...
- So why are you here?

1269
01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.630
Why are you
on this school trip?

1270
01:10:04.632 --> 01:10:06.399
I know you have a lot
of questions,

1271
01:10:06.401 --> 01:10:08.235
but we have to get out
of here, okay?

1272
01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:11.437
Okay. Okay. I can't believe
I figured it out!

1273
01:10:13.608 --> 01:10:16.476
You took everything from me!

1274
01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.681
This is for my family!

1275
01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:25.821
Pause.

1276
01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:28.754
Pause.

1277
01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:31.158
Uh... Sorry.

1278
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.160
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1279
01:10:34.162 --> 01:10:35.864
Yep. Stand by.

1280
01:10:39.867 --> 01:10:42.835
All right, fly, fly, fly,
zap, zap, zap.

1281
01:10:42.837 --> 01:10:45.405
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography,

1282
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.406
but it'll do.

1283
01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:47.973
Kill image.

1284
01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:49.946
De-cloak drones.

1285
01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.245
All right, weapons.

1286
01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:54.580
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1287
01:10:54.582 --> 01:10:56.952
Weapons only. Stand by.

1288
01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:06.825
Nice.

1289
01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:08.561
Stop.

1290
01:11:08.563 --> 01:11:10.329
Something.
I don't know what it is.

1291
01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:11.364
It's something...

1292
01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:13.833
Just dou...
You know what?

1293
01:11:13.835 --> 01:11:15.901
Double the damage
and then run it again.

1294
01:11:15.903 --> 01:11:17.503
You want me
to double it up?

1295
01:11:17.505 --> 01:11:18.972
- Yeah.
- All right.

1296
01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.843
Cover your ears.

1297
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:31.353
Whoo! That is good!
That's good.

1298
01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.187
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1299
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:36.690
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1300
01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.557
With her drones,
we'll create an event

1301
01:11:38.559 --> 01:11:40.259
big enough to cover
an entire city.

1302
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:42.628
Well done. Make sure
every drone is weapons-hot.

1303
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:43.929
We need maximum damage.

1304
01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:46.466
- Gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1305
01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.468
More casualties, more coverage.
Gotta cut through the static.

1306
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:51.436
London's a beautiful city,
it'll suffer,

1307
01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:54.074
but they can rebuild.
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1308
01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:58.277
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1309
01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:01.714
But when its new savior
descends,

1310
01:12:01.716 --> 01:12:04.918
all those casualties
will be forgotten.

1311
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.320
Janice, be in position
with my quick-change armor

1312
01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.954
- for the victory lap?
- Of course.

1313
01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:10.623
- You wanna try...?
- No, that's...

1314
01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:13.226
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1315
01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:15.762
Oh, one of the drones
that came back from the plaza

1316
01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.463
was missing a projector.
It's fine.

1317
01:12:17.465 --> 01:12:21.602
Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1318
01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:24.637
It's one drone. The image
will be perfect, I promise.

1319
01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:26.039
That projector is evidence.

1320
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.941
It's gonna tell people
what we're doing

1321
01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.375
and how we're doing it.

1322
01:12:29.377 --> 01:12:31.945
I am trying to fool
7 billion people here,

1323
01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.713
including Nick Fury, who happens
to be the most paranoid

1324
01:12:34.715 --> 01:12:36.649
and most dangerous person
on the planet.

1325
01:12:36.651 --> 01:12:38.618
If he catches on
before I've killed him,

1326
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.186
he will put a bullet
in my head.

1327
01:12:40.188 --> 01:12:42.857
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1328
01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.194
Right?

1329
01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:49.864
William,
can you look at me?

1330
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.169
Pull up EDITH.

1331
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:56.268
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1332
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:58.137
Hi, honey.
I need a level-five search,

1333
01:12:58.139 --> 01:13:00.173
full-resource protocol
for this device.

1334
01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.176
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1335
01:13:02.477 --> 01:13:03.942
There.
Search everything

1336
01:13:03.944 --> 01:13:06.045
going in and out
of that building.

1337
01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:07.683
<i>Located.</i>

1338
01:13:08.716 --> 01:13:10.051
Shit.

1339
01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.088
You know, William,
one day,

1340
01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:18.024
after I've had to kill
Peter Parker because of this,

1341
01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:22.531
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1342
01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:27.200
I can't believe
I gave Beck those glasses.

1343
01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.601
How could I be that stupid?

1344
01:13:28.603 --> 01:13:30.337
He's probably spying on me
right now

1345
01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:32.271
or sending a drone
to come and kill me.

1346
01:13:32.273 --> 01:13:34.975
You had access
to killer drones?

1347
01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.543
Yeah,
I didn't really want them,

1348
01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.445
especially after
I almost killed Brad.

1349
01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:40.045
You almost killed Brad?

1350
01:13:40.047 --> 01:13:42.214
Look,
I have to call Mr. Fury

1351
01:13:42.216 --> 01:13:44.051
and tell him
that Beck's a fraud...

1352
01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:47.253
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1353
01:13:47.255 --> 01:13:50.188
I need my suit,
and I have to go to Berlin

1354
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:53.227
and talk to Mr. Fury
in person.

1355
01:13:55.863 --> 01:13:57.896
Uh... Just...

1356
01:14:17.385 --> 01:14:18.852
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1357
01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.890
The costume looks great...

1358
01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:23.589
for the costume party

1359
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:25.926
at the prince's castle.

1360
01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.494
She knows.
I told her.

1361
01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:29.698
He didn't tell me.
I figured it out.

1362
01:14:30.998 --> 01:14:32.432
Oh.

1363
01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:33.432
That's cool.

1364
01:14:33.434 --> 01:14:34.602
Like, a long time ago.

1365
01:14:35.336 --> 01:14:36.335
Oh.

1366
01:14:36.337 --> 01:14:38.103
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1367
01:14:38.105 --> 01:14:40.406
But he saved me
and Betty's lives.

1368
01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:42.709
He's been faking the thing
with illusion tech.

1369
01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:45.212
Yeah, he's using these,
like, hologram projectors.

1370
01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.914
Whoa. That's crazy.

1371
01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:48.951
Yeah.

1372
01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:54.320
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1373
01:14:54.322 --> 01:14:56.155
It's been mostly me.

1374
01:14:56.157 --> 01:14:58.792
Ned, call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1375
01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:01.227
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin.

1376
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:02.628
Got it. Easy.

1377
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:05.932
Wow, you guys
lie with such ease.

1378
01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.167
I gotta go.

1379
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.968
Wait, wait, wait.
The projector.

1380
01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.936
You're gonna need this.

1381
01:15:10.938 --> 01:15:13.306
Don't tell anyone about this,
okay?

1382
01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.542
Anyone who knows
is in danger.

1383
01:15:22.884 --> 01:15:24.950
So you know too.

1384
01:15:24.952 --> 01:15:27.721
It's cool. I've known first,
and I've known longer,

1385
01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.989
but it's not a competition.
Heh.

1386
01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.646
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1387
01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:55.985
- <i>Nacht</i> Monkey!
- No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1388
01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.688
Get in.

1389
01:16:05.993 --> 01:16:07.227
Mr. Fury...

1390
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.361
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

1391
01:16:09.363 --> 01:16:11.630
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1392
01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:13.298
Okay.

1393
01:16:18.806 --> 01:16:19.707
Right.

1394
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:48.334
So is there anything
you want to tell us

1395
01:16:48.336 --> 01:16:49.436
about your girlfriend?

1396
01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.036
He's talking about
EDITH.

1397
01:16:51.038 --> 01:16:52.539
I made a mistake,
I'm sorry,

1398
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.207
but he is not
who you think he is.

1399
01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.508
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals,

1400
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.511
it's all fake.
He has some illusion tech.

1401
01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:01.547
That's how he tricked you,
and me into giving him EDITH.

1402
01:17:01.549 --> 01:17:05.418
It's a projector. I pulled it
off the fire monster in Prague.

1403
01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.753
So all that death
and destruction

1404
01:17:07.755 --> 01:17:10.589
we witnessed
was created by this?

1405
01:17:10.591 --> 01:17:13.025
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1406
01:17:13.027 --> 01:17:14.593
Well, if this is true,

1407
01:17:14.595 --> 01:17:18.263
then Beck's very dangerous
and we need to be smart.

1408
01:17:18.265 --> 01:17:19.902
Who else did you tell
about this?

1409
01:17:20.868 --> 01:17:23.201
Parker? Parker!

1410
01:17:23.203 --> 01:17:26.306
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1411
01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.310
What? Hill?

1412
01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.017
No, it's just an illu...

1413
01:17:36.317 --> 01:17:37.319
Fury!

1414
01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:40.755
Unh. Aah!

1415
01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.124
<i>Wow, Peter, wow.</i>

1416
01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:47.259
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1417
01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:50.829
<i>Fury always had to die,
but not you.</i>

1418
01:17:50.831 --> 01:17:51.966
Stop hiding, Beck!

1419
01:17:54.769 --> 01:17:56.735
<i>I tried to
help you walk away.</i>

1420
01:17:56.737 --> 01:17:58.204
<i>Now you're making me
do this.</i>

1421
01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:07.379
<i>You told me,
you were just a kid.</i>

1422
01:18:07.381 --> 01:18:10.750
<i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i>

1423
01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.654
- Help me!
- MJ!

1424
01:18:13.788 --> 01:18:14.822
Oh, God!

1425
01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:18.758
Peter, what's going on?

1426
01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.093
I know this isn't real.

1427
01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.427
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1428
01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.731
MJ!

1429
01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:26.665
MJ!

1430
01:18:28.502 --> 01:18:30.969
<i>I don't think you know
what's real, Peter.</i>

1431
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.643
Whoa! Whoa!

1432
01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:45.821
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1433
01:19:09.176 --> 01:19:11.679
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1434
01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:23.923
<i>You are just
a scared little kid</i>

1435
01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.694
<i>in a sweat suit.</i>

1436
01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.527
<i>I created Mysterio</i>

1437
01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:31.698
<i>to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1438
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.566
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1439
01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:36.271
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1440
01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:02.093
<i>If you were good enough,</i>

1441
01:20:02.095 --> 01:20:04.632
<i>maybe Tony would still
be alive.</i>

1442
01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:20.549
<i>Deep down,
you know I'm right.</i>

1443
01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:33.392
<i>You made your choice.</i>

1444
01:20:33.394 --> 01:20:36.596
<i>And all you had to do
was step aside.</i>

1445
01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.765
<i>And now you have...</i>

1446
01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.945
Fury. Unh.

1447
01:20:52.947 --> 01:20:56.414
Beck's people
are trying to find everyone

1448
01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:58.517
who could expose him.

1449
01:20:58.519 --> 01:20:59.785
Who'd you tell?

1450
01:20:59.787 --> 01:21:01.487
- Um...
- I know you told someone...

1451
01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:02.688
- Um...
- ...so just tell me.

1452
01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.490
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1453
01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.991
Who else did you tell?

1454
01:21:05.993 --> 01:21:07.761
Just Ned and MJ
from my class.

1455
01:21:07.763 --> 01:21:09.527
Maybe Ned told
his girlfriend Betty,

1456
01:21:09.529 --> 01:21:11.097
but that's it.

1457
01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.765
What?

1458
01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:15.500
You are so gullible.

1459
01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:17.637
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1460
01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:20.005
Just a...

1461
01:21:20.007 --> 01:21:21.508
...sucker.

1462
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.342
And now all your friends
have to die.

1463
01:21:23.344 --> 01:21:24.877
Oh, my God.

1464
01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:30.450
It's easy to fool people

1465
01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:32.921
when they're already fooling
themselves.

1466
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.527
But for what it's worth,
Peter,

1467
01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:41.997
I really am sorry.

1468
01:21:51.572 --> 01:21:53.039
- EDITH.
- <i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1469
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:56.709
Access files to
Peter Parker's class trip.

1470
01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.047
I need them to fly home
from London.

1471
01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.054
Hi.

1472
01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.553
Where am I?

1473
01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:43.890
Municipal holding
facility.

1474
01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:46.592
They said they found you
unconscious at the train yard.

1475
01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.826
Very dangerous.

1476
01:22:47.828 --> 01:22:49.094
And we gave you the shirt

1477
01:22:49.096 --> 01:22:51.164
because you seemed
a bit cold.

1478
01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:52.968
Thanks.

1479
01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:55.935
You guys are nice.

1480
01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:59.105
You speak really good
English.

1481
01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.406
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1482
01:23:01.408 --> 01:23:03.409
I'm in the Netherlands
right now?

1483
01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.813
Yep.

1484
01:23:06.046 --> 01:23:07.879
Bye. Aah!

1485
01:23:07.881 --> 01:23:10.615
- Guard!
- The guard is on a break.

1486
01:23:10.617 --> 01:23:13.119
- Probably talking to his wife.
- Yeah, she's pregnant.

1487
01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.486
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1488
01:23:22.496 --> 01:23:24.329
Yeah.

1489
01:23:24.331 --> 01:23:25.565
Yeah.

1490
01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.601
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1491
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:33.841
You guys okay?

1492
01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:47.920
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1493
01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:50.123
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1494
01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:54.494
Everyone is so nice here.
Uh...

1495
01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.631
Okay.

1496
01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.069
Okay.

1497
01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:07.774
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hey, hey, uh...

1498
01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:11.244
I messed up.
I need a... I need a ride.

1499
01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.745
Where am I?
Where am I, sir?

1500
01:24:13.747 --> 01:24:15.951
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1501
01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:19.951
Hang on.
Could you say that into there?

1502
01:24:19.953 --> 01:24:23.789
Hi.
It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1503
01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:25.958
Yeah, no problem.
Heh, heh.

1504
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.593
Thanks.

1505
01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:28.530
Did you get that?

1506
01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:52.618
Peter? Are you okay?

1507
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.487
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1508
01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:59.057
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1509
01:24:59.059 --> 01:25:01.893
Only I would know. Uh...

1510
01:25:01.895 --> 01:25:05.063
Remember we went to Germany?
You pay-per-viewed a video

1511
01:25:05.065 --> 01:25:07.066
in your room?
They didn't list titles,

1512
01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:09.569
but I could tell by the price
it was an adult film.

1513
01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:12.538
- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1514
01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:18.444
It's so good to see you.

1515
01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.713
Peter, you'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1516
01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:23.615
Okay, hold still.

1517
01:25:23.617 --> 01:25:25.419
There we go.

1518
01:25:31.224 --> 01:25:32.424
Ouch.

1519
01:25:32.426 --> 01:25:34.058
I thought you had
super strength.

1520
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.063
It still hurts.

1521
01:25:37.898 --> 01:25:40.602
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1522
01:25:42.069 --> 01:25:44.102
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God.

1523
01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:45.938
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1524
01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.309
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1525
01:25:49.276 --> 01:25:51.444
I trusted Beck. Right?

1526
01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:52.945
I thought he was my friend.

1527
01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.313
I gave him the only thing
Mr. Stark left for me,

1528
01:25:55.315 --> 01:25:57.984
and now he's gonna kill
my friends and half of Europe,

1529
01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.887
so please
do not tell me to relax.

1530
01:26:02.422 --> 01:26:05.490
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1531
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:09.998
I just really miss him.

1532
01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.467
Yeah, I miss him too.

1533
01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:17.936
Everywhere I go...

1534
01:26:17.938 --> 01:26:19.571
I see his face.

1535
01:26:19.573 --> 01:26:22.040
And the
whole world is asking

1536
01:26:22.042 --> 01:26:24.810
who's gonna be
the next Iron Man...

1537
01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:30.285
And I don't know if that's me,
Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1538
01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:34.387
You're not Iron Man.

1539
01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:36.289
You're never gonna be
Iron Man.

1540
01:26:38.158 --> 01:26:40.560
Nobody could live up
to Tony.

1541
01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:41.997
Not even Tony.

1542
01:26:43.497 --> 01:26:45.429
Tony was my best friend.

1543
01:26:45.431 --> 01:26:46.765
And he was a mess.

1544
01:26:46.767 --> 01:26:48.633
He second-guessed
everything he did.

1545
01:26:48.635 --> 01:26:50.335
He was all over the place.

1546
01:26:50.337 --> 01:26:53.338
The one thing that he did
that he didn't second-guess

1547
01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.942
was picking you.

1548
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:59.811
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1549
01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:03.317
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1550
01:27:04.618 --> 01:27:06.252
Now, your friends
are in trouble,

1551
01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:09.858
you're all alone,
your tech is missing.

1552
01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.328
What are you gonna do
about it?

1553
01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.798
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1554
01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.735
I mean, right now. Specifically,
what are we gonna do?

1555
01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.637
We've been hovering
over a tulip field

1556
01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:25.905
for the last 15 minutes.

1557
01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.640
Right.
I can't call my friends

1558
01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.342
because he's tracking
their phones.

1559
01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:30.575
Give me your phone.

1560
01:27:30.577 --> 01:27:31.910
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1561
01:27:31.912 --> 01:27:33.512
Okay. Here.

1562
01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:34.914
What's your password?

1563
01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:35.914
"Password."

1564
01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:37.583
No, what is your password?

1565
01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.918
- "Password," spelled out.
- Head of security,

1566
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.887
- and your password is "password"?
- I don't feel good about it.

1567
01:27:42.889 --> 01:27:46.025
<i>Hello, governor. Cup of tea?
I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1568
01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.093
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1569
01:27:48.095 --> 01:27:49.160
Yeah, I need a suit.

1570
01:27:49.162 --> 01:27:50.799
Suit?

1571
01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.852
Okay, um...

1572
01:28:13.854 --> 01:28:16.924
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1573
01:28:23.496 --> 01:28:26.100
Yeah, open that.
Okay, no, no, no.

1574
01:28:33.706 --> 01:28:36.374
- What?
- Nothing.

1575
01:28:36.376 --> 01:28:39.246
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1576
01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.919
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1577
01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:53.260
Okay, can you pull up
my web-shooters?

1578
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:55.628
Isolate the Taser webs,

1579
01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:58.030
and reconfigure
and boost the voltage

1580
01:28:58.032 --> 01:29:01.133
to a factor of 25 percent,

1581
01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:04.035
and give me complete
manual control over detonation.

1582
01:29:04.037 --> 01:29:07.138
<i>♪ Forget the hearse
'Cause I never die... ♪</i>

1583
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.141
I thought Kree
having sleeper cells

1584
01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:10.575
was top secret information.

1585
01:29:10.577 --> 01:29:13.212
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1586
01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.780
- I thought that was over.
- It's the biggest one yet.

1587
01:29:15.782 --> 01:29:17.616
- Where?
- London.

1588
01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:20.119
Okay, the company set up
a city tour,

1589
01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:23.291
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1590
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.959
Is no one else gonna
acknowledge how crazy this is?

1591
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:30.529
Oh, yeah, I get it.
There's been nothing scientific

1592
01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.030
about this science tour
at all.

1593
01:29:32.032 --> 01:29:33.798
No, no, I'm talking
about Peter.

1594
01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.633
Has no one noticed
how shady he is?

1595
01:29:35.635 --> 01:29:37.636
I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop

1596
01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.504
with some woman
in his underwear,

1597
01:29:39.506 --> 01:29:41.274
and he's always
sneaking away,

1598
01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:43.209
like back at the opera, huh?

1599
01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:46.678
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1600
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.084
Is no one else here
interested in the truth?

1601
01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:52.785
"The very concept
of objective truth

1602
01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:54.387
is fading out of the world."

1603
01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.289
George Orwell.
Thank you, MJ.

1604
01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:58.690
Yeah. Well, since
Peter's not really here

1605
01:29:58.692 --> 01:29:59.792
to tell his truth,

1606
01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.561
what about you, Brad?

1607
01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.896
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1608
01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.664
Yeah, dude,
what's that about?

1609
01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:08.366
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that. It was...

1610
01:30:08.368 --> 01:30:09.668
I was trying to take a...

1611
01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.704
Let's put all
this craziness behind us

1612
01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:14.573
and have a nice,
peaceful afternoon.

1613
01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:18.643
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class. Okay.

1614
01:30:18.645 --> 01:30:21.713
I'm gonna be a cool teacher
right now.

1615
01:30:21.715 --> 01:30:24.316
You gotta stop doing that.
It is weird.

1616
01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:28.053
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1617
01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.788
- Okay?
- Look at this.

1618
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:31.557
Mr. Harrington,
this is your bus.

1619
01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:34.860
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1620
01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.994
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1621
01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:39.030
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1622
01:30:39.032 --> 01:30:40.899
All right.

1623
01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:42.604
I have the kids.

1624
01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:48.406
I got here as fast as I could.

1625
01:30:48.408 --> 01:30:51.509
I did a full perimeter sweep.
Nothing.

1626
01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:52.413
Damn it.

1627
01:30:55.015 --> 01:30:56.214
Pulse is spiking.

1628
01:30:56.216 --> 01:30:57.682
I'll take
another look.

1629
01:30:57.684 --> 01:30:59.517
Soon as you see something,
report.

1630
01:30:59.519 --> 01:31:01.887
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1631
01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:04.559
If this is what I
fear, then God help us, Fury.

1632
01:31:05.826 --> 01:31:08.561
God help us all.

1633
01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.596
Okay, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1634
01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:13.531
- <i>William, launch the drones.</i>
- Copy that, brother.

1635
01:31:13.533 --> 01:31:17.268
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1636
01:31:22.742 --> 01:31:24.877
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1637
01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:26.111
Get those wrinkles out.

1638
01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:28.079
I could be shaking hands
with the queen.

1639
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.649
- <i>Guterman?</i>
- Almost in position.

1640
01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:32.217
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1641
01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:36.254
Whatever this is,
it's 100 times bigger

1642
01:31:36.256 --> 01:31:37.422
than the previous ones.

1643
01:31:37.424 --> 01:31:38.757
EDITH?

1644
01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.392
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1645
01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:42.160
Show me my loose ends.

1646
01:31:42.162 --> 01:31:43.995
Once the show's going,

1647
01:31:43.997 --> 01:31:45.830
execute the kill order
on my command.

1648
01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:47.065
- <i>Copy.</i>
- All right.

1649
01:31:47.067 --> 01:31:48.834
Start the show.

1650
01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:52.140
Let's save the world,
people.

1651
01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:57.343
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1652
01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.512
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1653
01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:03.748
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1654
01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.686
That doesn't
look good.

1655
01:32:08.688 --> 01:32:10.755
But it's fake,
nothing to worry about.

1656
01:32:10.757 --> 01:32:14.960
And the kids
are in the kill zone.

1657
01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:16.965
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1658
01:32:18.197 --> 01:32:19.865
What?

1659
01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.468
- <i>Happy Hogan here.</i>
- I know. What do you want?

1660
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.669
<i>At Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.</i>

1661
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:26.638
<i>There was a surfboard
you left behind.</i>

1662
01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.473
- What?
- <i>People said they didn't think</i>

1663
01:32:28.475 --> 01:32:31.744
<i>Nick Fury was a surfer, I said,
"Appearances can be deceiving."</i>

1664
01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:34.480
It's not mine. And don't ever
call this number again.

1665
01:32:42.322 --> 01:32:44.923
Fury's got the coded message.

1666
01:32:44.925 --> 01:32:46.758
Your friends
are at the Tower Bridge.

1667
01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.460
Your boy called it London
Bridge, but I figured it out.

1668
01:32:49.462 --> 01:32:51.163
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1669
01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:52.364
- We're close.
- We're close.

1670
01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:53.765
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1671
01:32:53.767 --> 01:32:55.167
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

1672
01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.802
Before you go,
if something happens to me,

1673
01:32:57.804 --> 01:32:59.538
could you please give
this to MJ?

1674
01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.807
You'll make it back.
Give it to her yourself.

1675
01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:03.275
- You got this.
- I got this.

1676
01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:06.177
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1677
01:33:06.179 --> 01:33:07.946
All I do
is get inside the illusion,

1678
01:33:07.948 --> 01:33:09.181
then I can take it down,

1679
01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.783
find him,
and he's just a guy.

1680
01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.217
I can take EDITH
right back.

1681
01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:14.719
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1682
01:33:14.721 --> 01:33:17.890
True, but this time...

1683
01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:20.825
How do I explain this? Uh...
I have a sixth sense.

1684
01:33:20.827 --> 01:33:24.463
The Peter-tingle. That's what
you're talking about, right?

1685
01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:25.731
It's not working, though.

1686
01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.700
I heard it wasn't working now.
Is it?

1687
01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:30.002
It is working.
I don't know if it's working...

1688
01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:32.070
You got the Peter-tingle.
That's the plan.

1689
01:33:32.072 --> 01:33:33.539
I'm gonna go get
your friends.

1690
01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.740
You get that Peter-tingle
back online.

1691
01:33:35.742 --> 01:33:36.909
I got this. I got this.

1692
01:33:51.524 --> 01:33:52.557
Cue the lightning.

1693
01:33:52.559 --> 01:33:54.661
Cuing lightning.

1694
01:33:59.399 --> 01:34:01.466
Sir, is it still safe
on the top,

1695
01:34:01.468 --> 01:34:03.735
or should we all come down?

1696
01:34:03.737 --> 01:34:04.671
Oh, my.

1697
01:34:06.573 --> 01:34:08.039
What did
the bus driver say?

1698
01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:09.641
Bus driver's gone.

1699
01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:11.142
- What?
- Where?

1700
01:34:11.144 --> 01:34:13.978
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I
have it under control!

1701
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.448
No. Don't drag me into this.

1702
01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:18.284
I'm doing my best,
Julius!

1703
01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:20.718
- Look...
- Oh, the witches are back.

1704
01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.023
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1705
01:34:27.827 --> 01:34:29.794
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1706
01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:35.003
Come on, let's go!

1707
01:34:47.313 --> 01:34:50.449
Now, that is
an Avengers-level threat.

1708
01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.834
This way. This way!

1709
01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.268
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1710
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:12.170
- Flash!
- Follow that hand.

1711
01:35:12.172 --> 01:35:13.938
This way. Follow me.

1712
01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:17.109
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1713
01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:19.445
Follow me, kids!

1714
01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:21.646
Earth, wind, fire, water.
Oh, no.

1715
01:35:21.648 --> 01:35:23.749
They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1716
01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.517
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1717
01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.485
Voltron!
You're thinking of Voltron!

1718
01:35:27.487 --> 01:35:29.355
Hey, look,
it's Mysterio!

1719
01:35:29.357 --> 01:35:31.024
He's gonna save us!

1720
01:35:33.693 --> 01:35:35.960
Wait, if Mysterio
knows we know...

1721
01:35:35.962 --> 01:35:38.129
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1722
01:35:38.131 --> 01:35:39.332
We should go.

1723
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.169
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1724
01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:46.673
This is for my family!

1725
01:35:48.076 --> 01:35:49.841
You should get
somewhere safe, Fury.

1726
01:35:49.843 --> 01:35:51.509
<i>I don't see this
ending well.</i>

1727
01:35:51.511 --> 01:35:53.512
I appreciate your concern,

1728
01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.516
but I never leave my men
behind.

1729
01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.418
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me?

1730
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.186
I can.
It's a little loud out here.

1731
01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:02.887
- I like the new suit.
- Thanks.

1732
01:36:02.889 --> 01:36:05.257
Whoa, Peter,
you sure that's not real?

1733
01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:07.859
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1734
01:36:07.861 --> 01:36:09.160
- Still the play?
- Uh-huh.

1735
01:36:09.162 --> 01:36:10.728
We need to get high enough

1736
01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:14.434
- so Beck doesn't see me coming.
- Copy. Stay sticky.

1737
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:19.036
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1738
01:36:19.038 --> 01:36:22.540
We need to have a conversation
about you and my aunt!

1739
01:36:36.523 --> 01:36:38.655
Beck, report!

1740
01:36:38.657 --> 01:36:41.159
I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1741
01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:42.660
"It's all the Elementals.

1742
01:36:42.662 --> 01:36:44.596
They're merged
into something..."

1743
01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:46.999
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1744
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:49.403
It's drawing energy
from the Earth's core.

1745
01:36:53.573 --> 01:36:56.008
See, now,
that's some bullshit.

1746
01:36:58.612 --> 01:36:59.546
Is that...?

1747
01:37:04.684 --> 01:37:06.116
Be ready for anything.

1748
01:37:06.118 --> 01:37:07.154
Yeah.

1749
01:37:13.059 --> 01:37:15.495
It's not real,
it's not real, it's not real!

1750
01:37:20.032 --> 01:37:22.267
Whoa.

1751
01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:24.071
That's awesome.

1752
01:37:49.295 --> 01:37:51.463
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1753
01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.798
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1754
01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.803
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1755
01:38:02.609 --> 01:38:04.776
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1756
01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:07.748
Yeah.
And I'm gonna kill him.

1757
01:38:12.452 --> 01:38:14.254
I hope this works.

1758
01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:31.439
You got me?

1759
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.043
I got you.

1760
01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:40.846
<i>Boss,
the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1761
01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.883
I see you.

1762
01:38:48.688 --> 01:38:50.690
- EDITH, give me protection.
- <i>Copy.</i>

1763
01:39:05.371 --> 01:39:07.004
Just kill the illusion.
Kill it.

1764
01:39:07.006 --> 01:39:08.374
I'm not gonna. They'll see.

1765
01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:10.909
They'll see
what I want them to see!

1766
01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:13.978
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1767
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:16.017
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1768
01:39:18.818 --> 01:39:21.319
- Now render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1769
01:39:21.321 --> 01:39:23.554
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1770
01:39:23.556 --> 01:39:24.759
There you are.

1771
01:39:28.528 --> 01:39:29.694
Easy.

1772
01:39:33.899 --> 01:39:35.333
Who the hell is that?

1773
01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.169
- Ned!
- Happy!

1774
01:39:38.171 --> 01:39:40.070
I gotta get you out of here!

1775
01:39:40.072 --> 01:39:41.438
- Get on the jet!
- Who are you?

1776
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.609
I work with Spider-Man.
Get on that jet.

1777
01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:45.444
You work for Spider-Man?

1778
01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.648
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1779
01:39:50.283 --> 01:39:52.383
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1780
01:39:52.385 --> 01:39:53.718
Happy, are you okay?

1781
01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.420
<i>We're okay. Just get Beck.</i>

1782
01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:57.888
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- <i>Copy.</i>

1783
01:40:02.261 --> 01:40:04.431
I'll just kill the kids
myself.

1784
01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:10.304
Whoa!

1785
01:40:19.112 --> 01:40:20.447
There you are.

1786
01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.650
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1787
01:40:24.652 --> 01:40:26.520
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1788
01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.022
- Go!
- Into the vault!

1789
01:40:32.024 --> 01:40:34.293
The walls are 8 feet thick.
Go into the vault!

1790
01:40:34.295 --> 01:40:35.593
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1791
01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:40.167
Take cover!

1792
01:40:58.652 --> 01:40:59.620
Okay.

1793
01:41:04.190 --> 01:41:05.289
Yeah?

1794
01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:07.127
No. No.

1795
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:12.665
I see you.

1796
01:41:14.934 --> 01:41:15.870
Get that thing out...

1797
01:41:21.474 --> 01:41:22.642
Go!

1798
01:41:29.515 --> 01:41:31.852
How does Cap do that?

1799
01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:44.195
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1800
01:41:44.197 --> 01:41:46.563
- <i>I'm here. I'm here.</i>
- Happy, thank God.

1801
01:41:46.565 --> 01:41:50.735
I bought us some time,
but not much.

1802
01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:54.040
I'm trying to get to Beck,
but I can't shake these drones!

1803
01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:09.623
Gotcha.

1804
01:42:31.377 --> 01:42:33.179
Going up!

1805
01:43:09.448 --> 01:43:10.448
Finally.

1806
01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.918
Hey, William, how we doing?

1807
01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.119
Illusion almost back up.

1808
01:43:15.121 --> 01:43:17.625
<i>I don't know
how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1809
01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.274
Oh, great. No webs.

1810
01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:49.190
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1811
01:43:51.791 --> 01:43:53.725
I wasted my life
playing video games,

1812
01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.526
and we're gonna die.

1813
01:43:55.528 --> 01:43:59.463
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1814
01:43:59.465 --> 01:44:02.200
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1815
01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:04.901
Hey, if it wasn't
for those stupid videos,

1816
01:44:04.903 --> 01:44:07.138
Spider-Man would've never
found you.

1817
01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:10.709
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man
follows me? I saved us, guys.

1818
01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.709
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1819
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:14.177
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1820
01:44:14.179 --> 01:44:15.646
I'm sorry, okay?

1821
01:44:15.648 --> 01:44:17.348
I'm obsessed
with telling the truth

1822
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:19.984
even if it hurts
other people's feelings.

1823
01:44:19.986 --> 01:44:22.022
I'm in love
with Spider-Man's aunt.

1824
01:44:26.091 --> 01:44:27.527
We're sharing, right?

1825
01:45:06.666 --> 01:45:09.401
Your lies are over, Beck.

1826
01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:13.003
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1827
01:45:13.005 --> 01:45:14.374
EDITH?

1828
01:45:22.181 --> 01:45:24.749
Just give me the glasses.

1829
01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:26.487
You want these?

1830
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.821
Come and get them.

1831
01:45:39.131 --> 01:45:40.563
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1832
01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:06.924
Why aren't
these drones firing?

1833
01:46:06.926 --> 01:46:08.793
<i>You're in the strike zone.</i>

1834
01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:12.866
- <i>The chance of getting hit is...</i>
- No, fire all the drones now!

1835
01:46:31.283 --> 01:46:32.851
Beck!

1836
01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.157
Beck.

1837
01:46:38.323 --> 01:46:39.856
You lied to me.

1838
01:46:39.858 --> 01:46:42.727
- And I trusted you.
- I know.

1839
01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:45.195
That's the most...

1840
01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:47.334
d-disappointing part.

1841
01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.504
You're a good person,
Peter.

1842
01:46:52.738 --> 01:46:54.540
Such a weakness.

1843
01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.875
Stark was right.

1844
01:46:58.877 --> 01:47:00.880
You do deserve them.

1845
01:47:12.024 --> 01:47:14.394
You can't trick me anymore.

1846
01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:20.198
EDITH,
turn off the drones.

1847
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.868
<i>Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1848
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.802
<i>Execute
all cancellation protocols?</i>

1849
01:47:25.804 --> 01:47:27.038
Just do it.

1850
01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.609
- Execute them all.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

1851
01:47:37.849 --> 01:47:39.918
Give me the spear.

1852
01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.388
That's a halberd. Ahem.

1853
01:47:46.425 --> 01:47:48.027
Thank you.

1854
01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:54.935
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1855
01:47:56.602 --> 01:48:00.340
People,
they need to believe.

1856
01:48:01.407 --> 01:48:03.276
And nowadays...

1857
01:48:05.077 --> 01:48:07.447
they'll believe anything.

1858
01:48:17.756 --> 01:48:19.192
Is he...?

1859
01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:21.795
Is this real?

1860
01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:25.598
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1861
01:48:40.078 --> 01:48:41.678
Whoo! Yeah!

1862
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.347
Hey, where you going?

1863
01:48:50.989 --> 01:48:52.225
- MJ.
- Hey.

1864
01:48:53.091 --> 01:48:54.459
- Hey.
- Hey.

1865
01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:56.293
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1866
01:48:56.295 --> 01:48:58.629
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1867
01:48:58.631 --> 01:49:01.499
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1868
01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:04.168
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1869
01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:07.440
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1870
01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:10.711
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1871
01:49:11.644 --> 01:49:13.180
Did you get him?

1872
01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.518
- Yeah.
- Well, I, um...

1873
01:49:19.019 --> 01:49:21.017
brought that.

1874
01:49:21.019 --> 01:49:23.320
In case
you needed some help.

1875
01:49:23.322 --> 01:49:25.325
Thanks.

1876
01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:28.426
Anyway, uh,

1877
01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:31.094
there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1878
01:49:31.096 --> 01:49:34.031
I think he works for you
or something.

1879
01:49:34.033 --> 01:49:35.165
He, um...

1880
01:49:35.167 --> 01:49:36.700
He gave me this.

1881
01:49:36.702 --> 01:49:38.638
No. No.

1882
01:49:40.139 --> 01:49:41.704
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1883
01:49:41.706 --> 01:49:43.842
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1884
01:49:43.844 --> 01:49:45.843
I wrote it down,
I was gonna buy you this

1885
01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.881
and give it to you in Paris
at the top...

1886
01:49:51.349 --> 01:49:52.784
And you kissed me.

1887
01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:55.453
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1888
01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.454
I don't really have
much luck

1889
01:49:57.456 --> 01:50:00.958
when it comes
to getting close to people.

1890
01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.764
Um... So I lied.

1891
01:50:05.063 --> 01:50:06.563
I wasn't just watching you

1892
01:50:06.565 --> 01:50:09.702
because I thought
you were Spider-Man.

1893
01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:15.075
That's great.

1894
01:50:16.542 --> 01:50:19.076
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1895
01:50:19.078 --> 01:50:21.212
- Good.
- Yeah. Heh.

1896
01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:22.914
Sorry it's broken.

1897
01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:25.783
I actually like it better
broken.

1898
01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:28.055
I really like you.

1899
01:50:29.755 --> 01:50:31.224
I really like you too.

1900
01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.891
Uh...

1901
01:50:45.304 --> 01:50:47.538
Uh. Okay. I should...

1902
01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.575
I should probably get back
to the class.

1903
01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:51.979
I'll go and...

1904
01:50:53.211 --> 01:50:55.482
- Yeah. Heh. I don't know.
- Heh. Okay.

1905
01:50:56.782 --> 01:50:57.850
Just in case.

1906
01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.458
Yeah, no.

1907
01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.794
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1908
01:51:10.796 --> 01:51:12.963
Yeah.
I'm glad he stayed too.

1909
01:51:12.965 --> 01:51:14.800
I gotta go.

1910
01:51:15.867 --> 01:51:17.133
I'm glad you're alive.

1911
01:51:17.135 --> 01:51:18.869
I guess the coded message
worked.

1912
01:51:18.871 --> 01:51:21.472
"Appearances can be
deceiving." Heh.

1913
01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.908
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1914
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:26.410
- It worked.
- Because I had serious doubts

1915
01:51:26.412 --> 01:51:27.878
about Beck
from the beginning.

1916
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.449
Not true.
He had zero doubts.

1917
01:51:33.118 --> 01:51:34.218
Where's Parker?

1918
01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.619
He's with a girl.

1919
01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:38.289
I need to speak with him.

1920
01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.091
He'll call you.

1921
01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:41.792
He'll...?

1922
01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:47.298
Okay. Great.

1923
01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.167
Well, he better.

1924
01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:50.269
Or it's your ass.

1925
01:51:51.737 --> 01:51:55.106
And don't even think
about ghosting me.

but the journey

- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1945
01:52:49.528 --> 01:52:51.862
Hello, Gerald.

1946
01:52:51.864 --> 01:52:54.067
Could Mother not make it?

1947
01:52:55.234 --> 01:52:56.737
Hmm.

1948
01:52:59.872 --> 01:53:01.438
- May!
- I promise you... Ah!

1949
01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:04.174
Oh, he's here.
Don't give me a ticket.

1950
01:53:04.176 --> 01:53:07.945
- Heh. Ah.
- Ooh. I'm so glad you're okay.

1951
01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:11.015
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1952
01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:12.816
Let's go.
Where are your bags?

1953
01:53:12.818 --> 01:53:14.218
Oh, right.
They got blown up.

1954
01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.020
Yeah. Heh.

1955
01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.489
I got you
hot buttered bagels.

1956
01:53:17.491 --> 01:53:19.589
- Thank you so much.
- I know my boy.

1957
01:53:19.591 --> 01:53:21.526
<i>I kept my
identity pretty guarded</i>

1958
01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.060
<i>this past couple years.</i>

1959
01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:24.861
<i>I faced a lot of deception.</i>

1960
01:53:24.863 --> 01:53:27.832
<i>And I'm tired of the lies.</i>

1961
01:53:27.834 --> 01:53:30.537
So it's time for the truth
to be out there.

1962
01:53:33.104 --> 01:53:34.107
Are you dating?

1963
01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:37.408
- Yes.
- Not really.

1964
01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:39.243
- What?
- Well...

1965
01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:40.744
- I think...
- Summer fling.

1966
01:53:40.746 --> 01:53:43.414
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1967
01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.182
I still don't know
where it's going.

1968
01:53:45.184 --> 01:53:46.683
Open to wherever
it might lead.

1969
01:53:46.685 --> 01:53:49.020
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1970
01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:50.954
We'll always be friends,
no matter what.

1971
01:53:50.956 --> 01:53:52.789
I'm gonna go
because I've got a date.

1972
01:53:52.791 --> 01:53:55.392
...because we
all are interconnected.

1973
01:53:55.394 --> 01:53:56.593
- Bye.
- We are.

1974
01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.042

Whoo-hoo!

1980

- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1981
01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:57.221

01:58:52.791 --> 01:58:54.691
<i>Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit.</i>

2046
01:58:54.693 --> 01:58:57.663
<i>Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...</i>

2047
01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:03.868
<i>Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker.</i>

2048
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:05.268
What the fu...?

2049
02:07:06.786 --> 02:07:09.555
<i>♪ Stop
Your messing around ♪</i>

2050
02:07:11.389 --> 02:07:13.423
<i>♪ Better think
Of your future... ♪</i>

2051
02:07:13.425 --> 02:07:15.394
You gotta tell him.

2052
02:07:16.795 --> 02:07:18.962
It was fine.

2053
02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:21.063
The little boy
handled it.

2054
02:07:21.065 --> 02:07:22.766
We helped.

2055
02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:23.900
- Talos.
- Come off it.

2056
02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:25.235
How was I supposed to know

2057
02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:26.703
that the whole thing
was fake?

2058
02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:29.106
I mean, that was all
very, very convincing.

2059
02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:30.774
The performances,
the illusion,

2060
02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.808
that costume,
the craftsmanship in that.

2061
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:35.982
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

2062
02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:41.084
Hey there. I hope your mission
is going well.

2063
02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:44.954
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

2064
02:07:44.956 --> 02:07:48.525
And it was very touching,
you know?

2065
02:07:48.527 --> 02:07:50.393
Really, really
quite touching.

2066
02:07:50.395 --> 02:07:51.794
Talos.

2067
02:07:51.796 --> 02:07:55.865
Um... And, you know,
shortly after that,

2068
02:07:55.867 --> 02:07:57.700
it really kind of went
off the rails,

2069
02:07:57.702 --> 02:07:59.203
so we need you to come back.

2070
02:07:59.205 --> 02:08:01.371
Everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

2071
02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.972
I don't know
what to say to that,

2072
02:08:02.974 --> 02:08:05.308
<i>so you're lucky
that Spider-Man won...</i>

2073
02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:29.535
Everybody back to work!

2074
02:08:36.407 --> 02:08:38.276
Who's got my shoes?

2075
02:08:40.226 --> 02:08:45.226
